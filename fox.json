Bush, under whom he had also served as a White House lawyer and staff secretary.\n\nIn his 12 years as a judge, Kavanaugh has issued approximately 300 opinions and delivered numerous speeches and legal arguments. Among them is his dissenting opinion on a pivotal gun ban in 2001.\n\nIn Heller v. District of Columbia, the D.C. Circuit Court upheld the District\u2019s ordinance banning most semi-automatic rifles. But in that case, Kavanaugh wrote the dissenting opinion, arguing the Supreme Court had already decided handguns \u2013 \u201cthe vast majority of which today are semi-automatic\u201d \u2013 are constitutionally protected under the Second Amendment.\n\nHe said despite gun violence in the area, \u201cour task is to apply the Constitution and the precedents of the Supreme Court, regardless of whether the result is one we agree with as a matter of first principles or policy.\u201d\n\nThe Supreme Court eventually took the case and struck down the ordinance; it held that the Second Amendment protects the possession of semi-automatic weapons for purposes unrelated to militia use.\n\nThe National Rifle Association applauded Kavanaugh\u2019s nomination as its president, Chris W. Cox, cited his \u201cimpressive record that demonstrates his strong support for the Second Amendment.\u201d\n\nOn the other side, the Giffords Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence derided the pick, saying he has \u201cissued prior rulings that are ideologically aligned with the gun lobby and reflect a radical interpretation of the Constitution under which public safety justifications play no role in Second Amendment jurisprudence.\u201d\n\nBut aside from gun-related legislation, lawmakers will have to sift through Kavanaugh\u2019s rulings on countless other issues as they decide whether to confirm him to the nation\u2019s highest court. Read on for a look at other opinions or decisions Kavanaugh is sure to be asked about in the coming months.\n\nAbortion\n\nAlthough he has not expressed outright opposition to abortion, liberals have already warned of the end of Roe v. Wade, the landmark Supreme Court decision that legalized abortion, should Kavanaugh be confirmed.\n\nKavanaugh did, however, issue a dissent in a 2017 case involving an illegal immigrant who wished to be released from custody in order to obtain an abortion. While the court eventually allowed her to have the procedure, Kavanaugh said the majority opinion was \u201cradically inconsistent with 40 years of Supreme Court precedent.\u201d\n\nA LOOK AT THE SUPREME COURT CONFIRMATION PROCESS\n\nHe argued if the government helped the 17-year-old obtain an abortion, then it ignores its \"permissible interest in favoring fetal life, protecting the best interests of a minor and refraining from facilitating abortion.\u201d\n\nDespite his dissent, Kavanaugh\u2019s words irked some anti-abortion conservatives who felt as though he did not go far enough. During oral arguments, Kavanaugh suggested releasing the teen to a sponsor which would \u201csolve the government\u2019s objection\u201d and allow her to get an abortion.\n\nPhillip Jauregui, president of the Judicial Action Group, said the case \u201cexemplifies why Kavanaugh is not the best available Supreme Court prospect\u201d in a memo last month.\n\nTrump has said he did not discuss abortion with Kavanaugh.\n\nThe Women\u2019s March called the choice of Kavanaugh \u201ca death sentence for thousands of women in the United States.\u201d\n\n\u201cStripping a woman\u2019s ability to make decisions about her own body is state violence,\u201d the group said. \u201cWe cannot let this stand. We will raise our voices and take to the streets.\u201d\n\nObamaCare\n\nKavanaugh\u2019s role in an ObamaCare decision had some conservatives on edge prior to his official nomination. As Fox News previously reported, Kavanaugh ultimately dissented in Seven-Sky v. Holder, a challenge to the Affordable Care Act.\n\nHowever, in his dissent, Kavanaugh did acknowledge the Affordable Care Act\u2019s \u201cindividual mandate provision\u201d could fit \u201ccomfortably within Congress\u2019 Taxing Clause power.\u201d\n\nConservative health care expert Christopher Jacobs argued Kavanaugh \u201ccultivated a theory\u201d that paved the way for Chief Justice John Roberts to uphold the individual mandate requiring people to purchase health insurance in 2012.\n\nWHO IS BRETT KAVANAUGH?\n\n\u201cEven as he avoided a definitive ruling on the merits of the case, Kavanaugh revealed himself as favorably disposed to the mandate,\u201d Jacobs wrote for The Federalist.\n\nReligious liberty\n\nIn 2015, Kavanaugh sided with organizations that argued ObamaCare\u2019s contraceptive coverage mandate infringed upon their religious rights.\n\n\u201cWhen the Government forces someone to take an action contrary to his or her sincere religious belief (here, submitting the form) or else suffer a financial penalty (which here is huge), the Government has substantially burdened the individual\u2019s exercise of religion,\u201d Kavanaugh wrote in the dissenting opinion in Priests for Life v. HHS.\n\nAt issue here was the form organizations were required to provide to the insurer or federal government in order to be exempt from a monetary penalty levied if they did not wish to include contraceptives in their insurance coverage. After a form is filed, then the insurer will still offer contraceptive coverage for employees through separate funds provided by the government or insurer. But religious organizations argued it made them complicit in providing coverage for contraceptives, thus violating their religious beliefs.\n\nKAVANAUGH NOD TOUCHES OFF SUPREME COURT CONFIRMATION BATTLE; DEMS WARN OF \u2018DEATHS OF COUNTLESS WOMEN\u2019\n\nRussell Moore, president of the Ethics & Religious Liberty Commission of the Southern Baptist Convention, said he is \u201cconfident\u201d Kavanaugh \u201cwill be a strong defender of the freedoms guaranteed by the Constitution and Bill of Rights, especially our First Freedom of religious liberty.\u201d\n\nPresidential protections\n\nKavanaugh worked with Kenneth Starr in the 1990s, co-writing the independent counsel\u2019s report laying out the legal framework supporting then-President Bill Clinton\u2019s impeachment. He said Clinton should be impeached because he misled the public and lied to his staff, according to The New York Times.\n\nBut in 2009, citing his role with the investigation into Clinton, Kavanaugh expressed his opinion that presidents should not have to deal with criminal investigations or civil lawsuits while in office.\n\nWHO ARE THE SUPREME COURT JUSTICES?\n\nWriting for the Minnesota Law Review, Kavanaugh said, \u201cI think we grossly underestimate how difficult the job [of U.S. president] is.\u201d Because of that, he said he believes \u201c[it's] vital that the President be able to focus on his never-ending tasks with as few distractions as possible.\u201d\n\n\"The nation certainly would have been better off if President Clinton could have focused on Osama bin Laden without being distracted by the Paula Jones sexual harassment case and its criminal investigation offshoots.\" - Brett Kavanaugh\n\n\u201cLooking back to the late 1990s, for example, the nation certainly would have been better off if President Clinton could have focused on Osama bin Laden without being distracted by the Paula Jones sexual harassment case and its criminal investigation offshoots,\u201d Kavanaugh said.\n\nKavanaugh said criminal investigations and civil lawsuits should simply be deferred \u2013 not eliminated \u2013 until he is out of office.\n\n\u201cEven the lesser burdens of a criminal investigation \u2013 including preparing for questioning by criminal investigators \u2013 are time-consuming and distracting. Like civil suits, criminal investigations take the President\u2019s focus away from his or her responsibilities to the people,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd a President who is concerned about an ongoing criminal investigation is almost inevitably going to do a worse job as President.\u201d\n\nFox News\u2019 Nicole Darrah, Alex Pappas, Gregg Re and The Associated Press contributed to this report.", "authors": ["Kaitlyn Schallhorn", "- Brett Kavanaugh"], "url": "http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2018/07/10/kavanaughs-staunch-gun-rights-defense-among-hundreds-decisions-in-spotlight.html"}, {"title": "Entire Thai soccer team, coach freed from cave after daring rescue, Navy says", "text": "The dramatic three-day rescue of a Thai youth soccer team that had been stuck in a flooded cave came to an end Tuesday when the last boy and the team's coach were plucked from the underground cavern -- more than two weeks after they became trapped, Navy officials said.\n\nThe Thai Navy SEALS said on Facebook all 12 boys from the team and the team's coach were out of the cave. Four rescuers, a doctor and three Navy SEALS remained inside until coming out of the cave two hours later.\n\n\"All 12 Wild Boars and coach have been extracted from the cave. Hooyah!\" the post said. The Navy SEALS later wrote: \"We are not sure if this is a miracle, a science, or what. All the thirteen Wild Boars are now out of the cave.\"\n\nEarlier in the day, local Thai media reports stated the 11th person emerged from the cave after two other people had been rescued. The conditions of all of those who were saved on Tuesday were unclear.\n\nChiang Rai Gov. Narongsak Osatanakorn said Tuesday's intricate and high-risk operation began just after 10 a.m. and involved 19 divers.\n\n\"We did something nobody thought possible,\" he said during a brief news conference after the rescue was complete.\n\nCheers and applause were reported in the streets as the final ambulance arrived at a hospital in Chiang Rai city. Payap Maiming, 40, who helped provide food and necessities to rescue workers and journalists, told the Associated Press a \"miracle\" had happened.\n\n\"I'm happy for Thais all over the country, for the people of Mae Sai, and actually just everyone in the world because every news channel has presented this story and this is what we have been waiting for,\" she said. Mae Sai is the district where the cave is located, in the northern part of Chiang Rai province, near the border with Myanmar.\n\n\"It's really a miracle,\" Payap said. \"It's hope and faith that has brought us this success.\"\n\nBefore the final rescue of the group, there was optimism that the dive team was getting more efficient in their attempts. They successfully extracted the second group of four a full two hours faster than the first, officials said.\n\nTHAI CAVE RESCUE TIMELINE: THE DANGEROUS RACE TO BRING TRAPPED SOCCER TEAM HOME\n\n\"Two days, eight Boars,\" read an earlier Facebook post by the Thai navy SEALS about the operation at the Tham Luan Nang Non cave that began Sunday, more than two weeks after the Wild Boars soccer team became trapped.\n\nSpaceX and Tesla head Elon Musk, who visited the cave, released photos of the situation on Twitter, and said his high-tech submarine was ready to help if needed.\n\n\"Just returned from Cave 3. Mini-sub is ready if needed,\" Musk tweeted. \"It is made of rocket parts & named Wild Boar after kids\u2019 soccer team. Leaving here in case it may be useful in the future. Thailand is so beautiful.\"\n\nBut despite his offer to help, the Thai rescue chief said it would be of little use for the rescue of the boys, according to Sky News.\n\n\"Although his technology is good and sophisticated it\u2019s not practical for this mission,\u201d Narongsak said.\n\nThe boy's families were being kept at a distance at a hospital because of fears of infection and the emaciated-looking boys were eating a rice-based porridge because they were still too weak to take regular food, authorities said.\n\nAt a news conference on Tuesday morning, officials said the second group of four boys brought out Monday are healthy, and that there are no bats inside the cave so there are no animals that can transit any diseases.\n\nJesada Chokdumrongsuk, deputy director-general of the Public Health Ministry, said Tuesday that the first four boys rescued, aged 12 to 16, are now able to eat normal food. He added that two of them possibly have a lung infection but all eight are generally \"healthy and smiling,\" and \"the kids are footballers so they have high immune systems.\"\n\nThe second group of four rescued on Monday are aged 12 to 14, and all are in \"high spirits,\" he added.\n\nDoctors are expecting to keep the boys in the hospital for at least 7 days, and said there are no complications with the boy's eyesight despite spending multiple days in the dark.\n\nThe parents of the first group of boys rescued on Sunday have visited their children through glass windows, as doctors continue to keep them \"isolated\" as they ensure they are healthy. The group has been vaccinated and given vitamin B1 and IV drips, according to officials.\n\nTHAILAND CAVE RESCUE OPERATION: 4 MORE BOYS FREED, BRINGING TOTAL TO 8\n\nThroughout the daring rescue, there was the risk of monsoon rains rising water in the cave endangering the team's dry refuge and making the escape route too treacherous.\n\nThe plight of the boys, aged 11-16, and their coach, has riveted Thailand and much of the world -- from the heart-sinking news they were missing to the first flickering video of the huddle of anxious yet smiling boys once they were found by the pair of British divers deep in the sprawling cave.\n\nPresident Trump congratulated the Thai navy SEALs and their international partners who rescued the team and their coach after more than two weeks of entrapment in a cave.\n\n\"On behalf of the United States, congratulations to the Thai Navy SEALs and all on the successful rescue of the 12 boys and their coach from the treacherous cave in Thailand,\" he wrote on Twitter. \"Such a beautiful moment - all freed, great job!\"\n\nWriting in elegant Thai script, the boys urged their parents not to worry, adding that they hoped they wouldn't get too much homework after being rescued and couldn't wait to eat their favorite foods again.\n\nThailand's prime minister said Tuesday that increased security will be introduced at the cave made \"world famous\" by this week's heroic rescue operation, Sky News reported.\n\n\"In future, we have to monitor the entrance and exit to the cave. This cave has become world famous,\" Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha said. \"We have to install more lights inside the cave and put up signs. It's a dangerous cave.\"\n\nAll preparations of the rescue, including replacing the oxygen cylinders positioned along the route out in the cave, take at least 20 hours, officials said. The safety of the divers, who have meticulously planned the mission, is also paramount. One diver died during preparations for the boys' extraction.\n\nFox News' Jeff Paul and Melissa Chrise in Chiang Rai, Thailand, and The Associated Press contributed to this report", "authors": ["Edmund Demarche", "Travis Fedschun"], "url": "http://www.foxnews.com/world/2018/07/10/entire-thai-soccer-team-coach-freed-from-cave-after-daring-rescue-navy-says.html"}, {"title": "US Postal worker found dead in California after delivering mail in extreme heat, family says", "text": "A longtime U.S. Postal worker was found dead in her truck on Friday after delivering mail when temperatures reached nearly 120 degrees in Southern California, her family said.\n\nPeggy Frank, 63, was found unresponsive in her truck around 3 p.m. in Woodland Hills, FOX11 reported.

While the president has denied wrongdoing and blasted the probe all along as a \"witch hunt,\" Democrats seized on the article as another reason to oppose Trump's nominee to replace Justice Anthony Kennedy.\n\n\u201cHe has said the president shouldn\u2019t be investigated,\u201d Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., said of Kavanaugh on MSNBC. \u201cHow is he going to react if [Special Counsel Robert] Mueller needs a subpoena, if Mueller needs some other action?\u201d\n\nSen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., also voiced concern about Kavanaugh\u2019s writing in a tweet Monday night, saying the judge \u201cthinks Presidents like Trump are above the law.\u201d\n\nIn the article, Kavanaugh did hedge a little by saying that no one in the U.S. is above the law, but added that the Constitution already provides a solution for dealing with a president who breaks the law.\n\n\u201cIf the President does something dastardly, the impeachment process is available,\u201d he wrote. \u201cIn short, the Constitution establishes a clear mechanism to deter executive malfeasance; we should not burden a sitting President with civil suits, criminal investigations, or criminal prosecutions.\u201d\n\nEarlier in his career in Washington, Kavanaugh joined independent counsel Kenneth Starr's team in investigating President Bill Clinton and co-wrote the report that served as the basis for Clinton\u2019s impeachment. But he later suggested the criminal investigations Clinton faced were bad for the country.\n\nThe Trump administration, meanwhile, pushed back on the criticism of Kavanaugh's 2009 article.\n\nA senior administration official said Kavanaugh was merely backing the idea of legislation -- stressing the difference between a legislative opinion and a constitutional opinion. The official said it's fair for senators to ask questions about such things, but it should not be used as a \"disqualifier.\"\n\nTrump lawyer Rudy Giuliani has already said that Mueller has assured Trump's legal team that he will follow longstanding DOJ guidance holding that a U.S. president is off limits for indictment.\n\nThis apparently refers to guidance from nearly two decades ago, when the Clinton administration's Justice Department reviewed 1973 guidance that \u201cthe indictment and criminal prosecution of a sitting President would unduly interfere\u201d with executive branch duties.\n\nNumerous Republican legislators have defended Kavanaugh, with Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell calling him \"a superb choice\" and Sen.

McSalty - Knight to Prius 2\n\nDEMS FACE BIG LOSS, BIG OPPORTUNITY WITH KAVANAUGH\n\nDemocrats say that they are prepared to mount a fervent, historic effort to keep Judge Brett Kavanaugh off of the Supreme Court, but it\u2019s kind of hard to believe them right now.\n\nTalking about it this morning, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer was only able to muster the glum resolution of a man contemplating a vegan hotdog. Mmm Mmm\u2026\n\nIt is true that Kavanaugh\u2019s all-but-certain elevation from the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals to the highest court in the land will be historic. Arguably for the first time since the 1930s, the Supreme Court will have a reliably right-of-center majority. For most of the post-World War II era, the court has been substantially focused on enhancing and shaping federal power in service of progressive policy aims. For the first time in a long time, the newly constituted Roberts court is likely to be more focused on constraining government activities.\n\nChief Justice John Roberts will become the swing vote and the only points on which he tends to disagree with his fellow Republican appointees is on just how narrowly to define the powers of the court itself.\n\nNo project has been more focused or more consuming for Americans in the past 40 years, so this victory will be sweet for them indeed.\n\nKavanaugh, a bright, thoughtful and richly qualified candidate starts with the presumption that every Republican will sign on to his nomination, which probably means that four or five Democrats from red states will get aboard as well.\n\nGiven the anguishing responses from Democrats since Justice Anthony Kennedy announced his retirement, they clearly understand how big a deal it is to have this shift toward small government conservatism on the court that has, since the 1950s, been their most successful vehicle for implementing large-scale policy changes.\n\nBut the historic nature of the moment does nothing to change the political calculus. President Trump is replacing a Republican appointee for whom Kavanaugh clerked and has apparently also been Kavanaugh\u2019s champion through the president\u2019s nominating process. While some conservatives are grousing that Trump did not shoot the moon with the pick and choose a more boldly conservative choice, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell understood the value of a well-vetted, well-liked nominee for what is going to be a sprint of a confirmation process.\n\nThe next term of the court starts in 83 days, which gives the Senate just enough time to push the nomination through. For context, the three most recent appointees to the Supreme Court, Neil Gorsuch, Elena Kagan and Sonia Sotomayor, were confirmed in 66 days, 87 days and 66 days respectively. A wild confirmation battle like the one that took Clarence Thomas 99 days from nomination to confirmation would not do.\n\nNo Supreme Court nominee has ever been rejected by a Senate in the hands of the same party as the president. And with Harry Reid\u2019s nuclear option in hand the chances for defeat or even significant delay appear rather remote.\n\nThough this may sound a little consolation to Democrats in the face of what looks to be a generational setback for the liberal cause, there is opportunity in this moment for the Blue Team.\n\nSchumer and his fellow Democrats do face some challenges in how to run their opposition effort. The loudest voices in his conference, especially those greasing the skids for potential 2020 presidential runs, would profit by being seen as extremists in defense of freedom, while moderates and those facing re-election in red states have lots of incentive to sound reasonable.\n\nDemocrat strategy has to take both of these sets of interests into account, which will essentially add up to allowing individual senators to take any rhetorical leaps they like while still trying to hold the line of unified opposition for as long as practical, at which point the defectors will be given hall passes to join the majority backing Kavanaugh.\n\nAlong the way, however, all of the scaremongering and doomsday talk will provide marvelous motivations for Democratic base voters and donors heading into the shank of the midterm campaign season.\n\nThis nomination may be a generational opportunity for Republicans, but their incipient defeat certainly provides a short-term opportunity for Democrats in their bid to hold Republicans to their current narrow majority in the Senate and take back the House.\n\nMuch of what you see over the next 12 weeks will be pure theater staged for the purpose of taking an already electrified Democratic base into new ecstasies of outrage and indignation.\n\nDemocrats will use the hearings and coverage around them to push their core issue set for 2018: Republican efforts to roll back taxpayer funded health insurance, perceived threats to minority protections and corruption within the Trump administration.\n\nIt\u2019s no wonder that the hearings are unlikely to be either useful or illuminating, but they will be a great opportunity for Democrats to dress up this vegan frankfurter with all the electoral fixings.\n\n\n\nTHE RULEBOOK: POPULARITY CONTEST\n\n\u201cIf it be true that all governments rest on opinion, it is no less true that the strength of opinion in each individual, and its practical influence on his conduct, depend much on the number which he supposes to have entertained the same opinion.\u201d \u2013 Alexander Hamilton or James Madison, Federalist No. 49\n\nTIME OUT: \u2018HE THAT TROUBLETH HIS OWN HOUSE\u2026\u2019\n\nOn this day 93 years ago, one of the most famous legal brawls in history began. National Humanities Center: \u201cBetween 1923 and 1925 four Southern states (Oklahoma, Florida, North Carolina, and Texas) tried, with mixed success, to stop the teaching of evolution in the public schools. In the spring of 1925 Tennessee joined the fray by passing the Butler Act, the strongest bill to that point. This law made it illegal \u2018to teach any theory that denies the Story of Divine Creation\u2026\u2019 In early May a Dayton mine manager and a local druggist (the latter also part-time chairman of the schoolbook committee) met with John Scopes, a young high school science teacher, to discuss resistance. \u2026 Scopes's friends arranged to have him arrested for teaching the forbidden doctrine. The ACLU quickly assembled its counsel, including the famous trial lawyer Clarence Darrow, a religious agnostic known for defending political and labor radicals. William Jennings Bryan, an attorney, a prominent Presbyterian layman, and three-time Presidential candidate on the Democratic ticket, volunteered his services as counsel for the State.\u201d\n\n\n\nFlag on the play? - Email us at\n\nHALFTIMEREPORT@FOXNEWS.COM with your tips, comments or questions.\n\nSCOREBOARD\n\nTrump job performance\n\nAverage approval: 41.2 percent\n\nAverage disapproval: 52.6 percent\n\nNet Score: -11.4 points\n\nChange from one week ago: down 0.8 points\n\n[Average includes: Gallup: 41% approve - 56% disapprove; Quinnipiac University: 40% approve - 55% disapprove; IBD: 41% approve - 54% disapprove; CNBC: 41% approve - 47% disapprove; USA Today/Suffolk University: 43% approve - 51% disapprove.]\n\n\n\nControl of House\n\nRepublican average: 41 percent\n\nDemocratic average: 48.2 percent\n\nAdvantage: Democrats plus 7.2 points\n\nChange from one week ago: no change\n\n[Average includes: Quinnipiac University: 50% Dems - 41% GOP; IBD: 48% Dems - 40% GOP; USA Today/Suffolk University: 45% Dems - 39% GOP; CNN: 50% Dems - 42% GOP; Gallup: 48% Dems - 43% GOP.]\n\n\n\nTIM RYAN DEBATES TAKING ON PELOSI\n\nPolitico: \u201cRep. Tim Ryan is considering taking on House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi again in November despite previously ruling out the idea \u2014 the latest turn in the caucus wide chaos unleashed by Rep. Joe Crowley\u2019s shocking primary loss last month. Ryan, who won one-third of the caucus\u2019 backing in a long-shot bid following the 2016 election, would be the first challenger to emerge against Pelosi in the post-Crowley world. Crowley, the No. 4 House Democrat defeated by progressive insurgent Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, was seen by many in the caucus as Pelosi\u2019s heir apparent. \u2018The Crowley race changed a lot for a lot of us,\u2019 Ryan (D-Ohio) said in an interview Monday. \u2026 Ryan\u2019s potential reemergence is just one of the many machinations happening in the Democratic Caucus right now, as Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s victory in New York underscores the growing unrest with Pelosi and the party\u2019s leadership.\u201d\n\nNRCC dumps Jew Jersey nominee over racist rants - WaPo: \u201cThe National Republican Congressional Committee has withdrawn its endorsement of a congressional candidate in New Jersey after reporters dug up offensive comments he\u2019d made about black and Hispanic people. \u2026 [Seth Grossman], a former elected official in Atlantic County, was not the party\u2019s first choice to run in New Jersey\u2019s 2nd District. Rep. Frank A. LoBiondo (R-N.J.) announced his retirement late last year\u2026 No strong candidate emerged, and Grossman won the four-way June 5 primary with 39 percent of the vote. Almost immediately, Democratic and liberal groups began digging through his social media and through videos from candidate forums. In one video, Grossman answered a question about how Republicans could reach more diverse groups of voters by saying \u2018the whole idea of diversity is a bunch of crap, and un-American,\u2019 having \u2018become an excuse by Democrats, communists, and socialists, to say that we\u2019re not all created equal.\u2019\u201d\n\nWisconsin\u2019s Democratic primary for Ryan\u2019s seat turns into a brawl - WaPo: \u201cOn Friday, CNN reported that Randy Bryce, the Democratic union organizer running for Congress in Wisconsin\u2019s 1st District, had been arrested for marijuana possession in 1991 and driving under the influence of alcohol in 1998. Bryce owned up to the arrests, and told CNN that he had grown and changed over the past 20 years. But the timing was brutal: Bryce was 48 hours away from debating Cathy Myers, a school board member in Paul D. Ryan\u2019s hometown of Janesville, who is also seeking the Democratic nomination for the retiring House speaker\u2019s seat. When they met, in front of 200 voters in a high school auditorium, it took Myers just 30 seconds to go on the attack. \u2026 The Democratic primary in Ryan\u2019s southeast Wisconsin district, which has been reliably Republican since the party\u2019s 1994 landslide, has quietly become one of the most bitter in the country. Bryce entered the race last June with a viral video ad that made him a left-wing sensation\u2026 Myers declared her own candidacy a few days later, and did not become a left-wing sensation.\u201d\n\nRecords don\u2019t show business Jacky Rosen has touted - Reno Gazette Journal:\u201cOn the campaign trail and in nearly a dozen media interviews, U.S. Rep. Jacky Rosen, D-Nev., has regularly touted her efforts to build a business after moving to Southern Nevada in 1980. Yet a Reno Gazette Journal review of public records found no evidence that Rosen held a state or local business license for the software consulting shop she\u2019s referenced in interviews with C-SPAN, NBC Reno and other media outlets. Rosen \u2014 a Chicago native and political newcomer looking to flip one of the country\u2019s most coveted U.S. Senate seats \u2014 ran the unnamed, one-woman operation between 1993 and 2002, according to her campaign.

Mrs May is attempting to shore up her position in Downing Street following the resignations of David Davis and Boris Johnson amid disquiet over her approach to Brexit. Mr Trump insisted he got along \u2018very well\u2019 with Mrs May - but he also described Mr Johnson as a \u2018friend of mine.\u2019 When asked if the PM agrees with the US president's view that the UK is in \u2018turmoil,\u2019 Mrs May's official spokesman said she hopes Mr Trump will have a positive view of Britain following his visit. Speaking as he got ready to leave for a trip to Europe that will see him meet Mrs May at a NATO summit in Brussels and then make his first visit to the UK as president, Mr Trump suggested he could make time to see Mr Johnson.\u201d\n\nDominic Green: May is done, sooner or later - Weekly Standard: \u201cTheresa May\u2019s hapless government has staggered on for a year since losing its parliamentary majority in the 2017 elections, but the resignation Monday of Brexit minister David Davis and foreign secretary Boris Johnson means that the end is in sight for an unpopular and incompetent leader. In a twist typical of May\u2019s shoddy and inept leadership, she tried to force her cabinet into collective responsibility for a Brexit policy that walked back from May\u2019s own campaign promises and policy statements, only for the gambit to backfire. A vote of no confidence from Conservative MPs is now on the cards, and the sooner the better.\u201d\n\n\n\nCarl Bildt: Brexit crackup reveals empty promises - WaPo: \u201cThe United Kingdom is crashing into the fundamental intellectual dishonesty of its brave Brexit campaigners: No one on the pro-Brexit side had the courage or the competence to explain alternatives to membership in the European Union. Now, after the resignations of lead Brexit Secretary David Davis and Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson, the UK\u2019s political system is degenerating into a furious fistfight between advocates of different bad options. It\u2019s ugly, and it\u2019s likely to get worse. More than two years have passed since the referendum, but Davis had not spent more than four hours in trying to negotiate with his E.U. counterpart Michel Barnier. And the clock is ticking: The UK is supposed to leave the E.U. by March 2019; there has to be an agreement on the exit terms and the transition period before October.\u201d\n\n\n\nAllies brace for Trump attacks - Bloomberg: \u201cWhen Donald Trump barrels into Brussels this week demanding that NATO allies boost their defense spending, the response will be: We already are. But for the U.S. president, military budgets are only one line of attack. From \u2018easy to win\u2019 trade wars to the system of setting oil prices, Trump is on a mission to rip up the world order and remake it in what he sees as America\u2019s interests. That includes targeting multilateral institutions such as the World Trade Organization and the Group of Seven. As Trump prepares to meet with Russia\u2019s Vladimir Putin, North Atlantic Treaty Organization leaders studying the president\u2019s tweets would be forgiven for wondering if NATO is next in his sights.\u201d\n\nPLAY-BY-PLAY\n\nScalise goes to bat for Jordan amid sex abuse scandal - Politico\n\n\n\n\u2018Insta-Congressman\u2019 takes office to replace Farenthold today - [Austin] Statesman\n\nHoyer returning to Capitol this week after hospitalization for pneumonia - Roll Call\n\n\n\nSon of Bevin\u2019s predecessor looks to take incumbent out in 2019 - Louisville Courier Journal\n\nAUDIBLE: SEN.

At least three vehicles had windshield damage after the giant chess pieces were tossed over the rooftop and landed below, according to a police report. Police said at least four people were involved.

They know they have almost no chance of preventing his confirmation.\n\nKavanaugh is widely liked in Washington legal circles. He gave a humanizing introductory speech after the president introduced him at a White House ceremony.\n\nThe judge has impeccable educational qualifications and already serves on the powerful U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia. He is even respected by liberals such as Supreme Court Justice Elena Kagan, who hired him to teach at Harvard Law School before she joined the high court.\n\nDemocrats were worried about the danger of having Kavanaugh on a track to the Supreme Court back in 2003 when he was appointed by President George W. Bush to the D.C. federal circuit court. They blocked a vote on his confirmation for three years, and only four Democrats ultimately voted for him.\n\nSenate Minority Whip Dick Durbin, D-Ill., made his concerns public at Kavanaugh\u2019s 2006 confirmation hearing when he told the nominee: \u201cAs I look through all of the different issues that you have been involved in as an attorney in public service and the private sector, it seems that you are the Zelig or Forrest Gump of Republican politics. You show up at every scene of the\n\ncrime. You are somehow or another deeply involved, whether it is Elian Gonzalez or the Starr Report, you are there.\u201d\n\nDurbin and his liberal colleagues know there is only one narrow path to stopping Kavanaugh.\n\nRight now, the question isn\u2019t if Kavanaugh is likely to be confirmed, but how many Democrats will find themselves torn between the left wing of their party and political reality.\n\nFirst, Democratic leaders must convince all of the 10 Democratic senators up for re-election in November in states that Donald Trump carried in the 2016 presidential election to oppose his Supreme Court nominee, even at the risk of alienating their constituents.\n\nOf these 10 Democratic senators, the most likely to vote to confirm Kavanaugh are Heidi Heitkamp of North Dakota, Joe Donnelly of Indiana and Joe Manchin of West Virginia. All voted in favor of President Trump\u2019s nomination of Neil Gorsuch to the Supreme Court last year.\n\nIn addition to pressuring every single Democratic senator to oppose Kavanaugh, Democratic leaders must launch a vicious assault to get Republican Senators Susan Collins of Maine and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska to oppose Kavanaugh.\n\nIn what could be dubbed Project Fear, Democrats who want Collins and Murkowski to join them in opposing Kavanaugh\u2019s confirmation will claim the judge will vote to overturn Roe v. Wade \u2013 the 1973 decision that legalized abortion nationwide \u2013 and will say that Kavanaugh will end ObamaCare.\n\nBoth Senators Collins and Murkowski have stated they would have trouble voting for a nominee who has indicated the intention to overturn Roe v. Wade. They also joined Sen. John McCain, R- Ariz., in derailing the GOP\u2019s effort to replace ObamaCare in 2017.\n\nMcCain, who is ill with brain cancer back in Arizona, is unlikely to be able to return to Washington to vote on Kavanaugh\u2019s confirmation.\n\nBut I don\u2019t believe there is a realistic chance \u2013 absent the revelation of a personal scandal or an unlikely verbal mistake by Kavanaugh \u2013 that either Collins or Murkowski will vote against him. Both senators have voted for all of President Trump\u2019s judicial nominees and overall they have backed the Trump legislative agenda: 80 percent of the time for Collins and 84 percent of the time for Murkowski.\n\nThen there is the issue of political survival. As reporter Perry Bacon points out in FiveThirtyEight: \u201cSuch a vote would virtually guarantee that the offending GOP senator would face a primary challenge in their next election \u2013 and likely a challenge with strong support from the party base.\u201d\n\nBoth Collins and Murkowski have reason to worry on that front. In 2010, Murkowski actually lost her Republican primary in Alaska to tea party insurgent Joe Miller.\n\nIt was only through an effort worthy of Hercules that the party establishment was able to take advantage of Miller\u2019s rookie mistakes in the general election and re-elect Murkowski on the basis of write-in votes. That establishment support would be absent for Murkowski if she were to break with her party on such a high-profile vote as Kavanaugh.\n\nAnd voter suspicion about Murkowski is still present in Alaska.\n\nRunning for re-election in 2016 against a hapless Democrat and against Miller (running as a Libertarian this time), Murkowski was only able to defeat her underfunded third-party challenger by 44 percent to 29 percent. The Democratic candidate for the Senate seat from Alaska got only 12 percent of the vote. Changing parties after voting against Kavanaugh would not be an option for Murkowski.\n\nThe situation is similar for Susan Collins in Maine. Despite being in New England, Maine is not a liberal state. It has elected conservative Gov. Paul LePage twice and the GOP controls one of its two legislative chambers.\n\nIn 2016, Hillary Clinton narrowly won the state 48 percent to 45 percent for Trump, but if you added Libertarian Gary Johnson\u2019s 5 percent to Trump\u2019s total, Clinton\u2019s performance was anemic.\n\nCollins knows that were she to vote against Kavanaugh she would face a bitter inter-party challenge in 2020, and in a closed primary in which only Republicans can vote.\n\n\u201cPolitically for Susan \u2026 it\u2019s very hazardous right now for her to take on President Trump,\u201d former Rhode Island Senator Lincoln Chafee, a former Republican who has become a Democrat, told the Boston Globe. \u201cMaine has its strong Trump core. Even if they\u2019re pro-choice I think in this environment many of these people just want to blindly support President Trump, and any deviation from his agenda can be hazardous and invite a primary challenge.\u201d\n\nThese factors make it unlikely that Democrats can peel away either GOP senator to oppose Kavanaugh\u2019s nomination. If they fail they will have to worry that several of their vulnerable incumbents up for re-election in November will vote for Kavanaugh\u2019s confirmation so they can bolster their credentials as moderates.\n\nRight now, the question isn\u2019t if Kavanaugh is likely to be confirmed, but how many Democrats will find themselves torn between the left wing of their party and political reality.", "authors": ["John Fund"], "url": "http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2018/07/10/john-fund-kavanaugh-can-only-be-stopped-by-one-narrow-path-durbin-schumer-know-what-it-is.html"}, {"title": "Reactions to Trump's Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh", "text": "", "authors": [], "url": "http://video.foxnews.com/v/5807548912001/"}, {"title": "Michael Cohen's lawyer issues cryptic warning to Giuliani and Trump", "text": "The lawyer representing President Trump\u2019s former personal attorney Michael Cohen issued a cryptic warning to the president and his lawyer Rudy Giuliani this week, in apparent reference to what his client could share with federal prosecutors.\n\nCohen, who is under criminal investigation as part of a federal grand jury probe into his personal business dealings, retained former White House special counsel Lanny Davis last week to represent him.\n\nDavis, who served under former President Bill Clinton, seemingly challenged Giuliani on Monday for saying his client should tell the truth.\n\n\u201cDid @rudygiuliani really say on Sunday shows that @michaelcohen212 should cooperate with prosecutors and tell the truth?

None.\u201d\n\nSpeculation is widespread about what the pressure on Cohen could mean for the special counsel probe into Russian meddling and potential collusion with the Trump campaign in 2016.\n\nIt is unclear whether Cohen actually has any information about alleged criminal wrongdoing by Trump or his campaign associates that could help Special Counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s investigation. Trump has denied wrongdoing and repeatedly blasted the probe as a \u201cwitch hunt.\u201d Trump has also publicly said Cohen would not make up \u201cstories\u201d and \u201cflip.\u201d\n\nBut Cohen, who was Trump\u2019s self-described fixer and a key player in the Trump Organization for more than a decade, is seemingly making efforts to distance himself from the president.\n\nCohen, who was once quoted as saying he would \u201ctake a bullet\u201d for Trump, gave an interview to ABC News last week saying that his own family has his \u201cfirst loyalty.\u201d Cohen also parted with Trump on his criticism of the FBI.\n\n\u201cMy wife, my daughter and my son have my first loyalty and always will,\u201d Cohen told ABC at a Manhattan hotel last week. \u201cI put family and country first.\u201d\n\nABC News\u2019 George Stephanopoulos asked Cohen how he would respond if the president or his legal team came after him and tried to discredit the work he did for Trump over the last decade.\n\n\u201cI will not be a punching bag as part of anyone\u2019s defense strategy,\u201d Cohen was quoted as saying. \u201cI am not a villain of this story, and I will not allow others to try to depict me that way.\u201d\n\nCohen also said he did not agree \u201cwith those who demonize or vilify the FBI. I respect the FBI as an institution, as well as their agents.\u201d He reportedly said he doesn\u2019t \u201clike the term witch hunt.\u201d\n\nHOW MICHAEL COHEN DECIDED TO SEND TRUMP A CAREFULLY CALIBRATED MESSAGE\n\nPart of the investigation into Cohen involves the $130,000 \u201chush money\u201d payment to adult film star Stormy Daniels in the weeks leading up to the 2016 presidential election in exchange for her silence about an alleged one-time sexual encounter with Trump. Cohen, in the past, has said the payment was made on his own initiative, but in the ABC News interview, Cohen said he couldn\u2019t comment on advice of his lawyer.\n\n\"I want to answer. One day I will answer,\" he was quoted as saying.\n\nCohen hired Davis just days after the interview.\n\n\u201cLike most of America, I have been following the matter regarding Michael Cohen with great interest. As an attorney, I have talked to Michael many times in the last two weeks,\u201d Davis said in a statement to Fox News after being retained. \u201cThen I read his words published on July 2, I recognized his sincerity. Michael Cohen deserves to tell his side of the story\u2014subject, of course, to the advice of counsel.\u201d\n\nDavis, days later, slammed the \u201chigh interest\u201d in his representation of Cohen.\n\n\u201cWhy is my representing @MichaelCohen212 as attorney of such high interest? Not about me. It\u2019s about a nation\u2019s yearning for truth. And Michael Cohen has said it\u2019s time for him to speak the truth and put his family and Country first.

But on Tuesday, the defense signaled Flynn\u2019s cooperation may be complete, saying they do not anticipate facts in the case changing.\n\nSullivan, who took over the case after the sudden recusal of the recusal of U.S. District Judge Rudy Contreras last year, said Tuesday he wanted to meet both parties before sentencing.\n\nThe judge floated Aug. 24 as a possible date for the next hearing, suggesting it\u2019s possible sentencing could take place 60 days after that.\n\nFueling intrigue in the case is a report from the House Intelligence Committee in May stating that former FBI Director James Comey testified to the committee that FBI agents did not believe that Flynn intentionally lied about talks with Russia\u2019s ambassador.\n\nComey, who has been on tour promoting his new book, has suggested his testimony about Flynn had been misunderstood, saying \u201csomeone misunderstood something I said. I didn\u2019t believe that and didn\u2019t say that.\u201d\n\nBut the House report also states that then-FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe said the FBI didn\u2019t \u201cdetect deception\u201d from Flynn in the interview.\n\nFox News\u2019 Catherine Herridge and Jake Gibson contributed to this report.", "authors": ["Alex Pappas"], "url": "http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2018/07/10/flynn-eager-to-proceed-to-sentencing-after-mysterious-delays.html"}, {"title": "How Michael Cohen decided to send Trump a carefully calibrated message", "text": "It's quite obvious that Michael Cohen was sending a sharp message when he sat down with ABC's George Stephanopoulos.\n\nWhat is less apparent is how deliberate and carefully crafted his words were, especially on subjects that don't directly involve him, and his strategy toward the intended recipient: President Trump.\n\nBased on my reporting, the president's former personal lawyer was not only issuing a declaration of independence from his longtime boss, he was telling the world that he doesn't agree with some of Trump\u2019s core positions.\n\nAnd the phrases were carefully rehearsed as a finger-in-the-eye shot at Trump, not just to calmly convey that he will not be a \"punching bag\" or cast as a \"villain\" as \"part of anyone's defense strategy.\"\n\nCohen has dual goals. Having become a key figure in a federal investigation, he is trying to better position himself to make a deal if in fact he winds up facing criminal charges. And he is taking the first step toward restoring his battered reputation in the court of public opinion.\n\nOn a personal level, I'm told, Cohen at times has been angry and depressed over being drawn into the Robert Mueller probe because of his past service to Trump. But he has felt relieved since the ABC sitdown made headlines, believing that he can redeem himself only if he is not viewed as a blind Trump supporter.\n\nCohen is not proud of some of what he's done for Trump in the past, I'm told, but made his judgments at the time and believes some of the current criticism is based on 20/20 hindsight.\n\nThe New York lawyer, often dubbed Trump's \"fixer,\" recently parted company with his attorneys and hired former prosecutor Guy Petrillo and former Clinton White House lawyer Lanny Davis.\n\nOne major clue to the interview, based on my reporting, is in Cohen's answers involving the president's ongoing battles with law-enforcement officials and the intelligence community, and even his foreign policy.\n\nThese are far afield from the subjects that Cohen has generally discussed in the past.\n\nCohen took a firm stance on Russian meddling in the 2016 campaign, a conclusion that the president has never fully embraced.\n\n\"I repudiate Russia's or any other foreign government's attempt to interfere or meddle in our democratic process,\" he said. Breaking with Trump, Cohen said that \"I respect our nation's intelligence agencies\" and their \"unanimous conclusions\" about Moscow's role. In perhaps the most direct challenge to Trump, who will meet with the Russian leader this month, he declared: \"Simply accepting the denial of Mr. Putin is unsustainable.\"\n\nAs part of his distancing strategy, Cohen even took on the 2016 Trump Tower meeting between Donald Trump Jr., Paul Manafort and Jared Kushner and a Russian lawyer said to be offering dirt on Hillary Clinton. Cohen called that a \"mistake\" and \"poor judgment\" by those members of the Trump camp.\n\nIn declining to criticize Mueller's Russia probe, Cohen explicitly rejected Trump's favorite phrase for discrediting the special counsel and his operation: \"I don't like the term witch hunt.\"\n\nCohen has said before that the FBI agents who raided his home and hotel room \u2013 in what the president termed \"an attack on our country\" \u2014 acted professionally. With Stephanopoulos, he added: \"I don't agree with those who demonize or vilify the FBI. I respect the FBI as an institution, as well as their agents.\"\n\nOnce a registered Democrat, Cohen views the president as having made inaccurate statements about the FBI and intelligence officials, and this has contributed to his sense of alienation and the belief that his onetime patron has changed. Those sentiments are inextricably tied to Cohen's more personal sense of disappointment that he feels abandoned by Trump.\n\nCohen declined in the interview to answer questions, on his lawyers' advice, about the $130,000 payment he made in the campaign's final weeks to porn actress Stormy Daniels to stay quiet about what she alleges was a 2006 affair with Trump. Cohen may have some legal exposure stemming from the hush money, for which he was reimbursed by Trump.\n\nSuch questions, which would obviously be part of any interview, were the reason that Cohen decided to speak to the \"Good Morning America\" co-anchor on the record but off camera. Cohen and his team did not want viral video clips of him repeatedly refusing to answer questions.\n\nJournalists constantly speculate about whether Cohen will flip, by deciding to testify against Trump in exchange for immunity. That question cannot be answered at the moment because his lawyers have no way of knowing what charges, if any, he may face. And while Cohen could undoubtedly offer embarrassing details about the celebrity businessman he served, it is far from clear that he is sitting on any legally damaging information.\n\nRudy Giuliani, Trump's lawyer, took a noticeably supportive tone toward Cohen yesterday, saying he should cooperate with prosecutors. \"I'm hoping that Michael is able to clear himself because I think what was done to him was really unfair ... I have no concerns that Michael Cohen is going to do anything but tell the truth,\" the former New York mayor told Stephanopoulos on \"This Week.\"\n\nSome media chatter suggests that Cohen made his move in hopes of obtaining an eventual pardon from the president. But I'm told that he would be following a make-nice approach, rather than a confrontational one, if that was his goal.\n\nMichael Cohen once famously said he would take a bullet for Donald Trump. If he was trying to alert the president and his legal team that the offer no longer stands, he succeeded.", "authors": ["Howard Kurtz"], "url": "http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2018/07/09/how-michael-cohen-decided-to-send-trump-carefully-calibrated-message.html"}, {"title": "Trump says FBI's Strzok, Page getting 'cold feet' ahead of Capitol Hill sessions", "text": "President Trump claimed Tuesday that \u201cFBI lovers\u201d Peter Strzok and Lisa Page are getting \u201ccold feet\u201d ahead of planned Capitol Hill appearances this week, amid conflicting reports over whether they will show up.\n\nBoth officials, who previously worked on the Russia probe, have faced congressional and internal scrutiny over anti-Trump text messages.

However, a congressional source suggested former FBI lawyer Page may not show up for her closed-door Wednesday deposition.\n\n\u201cI am on Air Force One flying to NATO and hear reports that the FBI lovers, Peter Strzok and Lisa Page are getting cold feet on testifying about the Rigged Witch Hunt headed by 13 Angry Democrats and people that worked for Obama for 8 years.

Attorneys for Strzok, who gave his private interview last month, and the committee reached a similar arrangement after he was subpoenaed.\n\nStrzok is expected to testify in public before both committees on Thursday and face questions from lawmakers on his involvement in the start of the FBI\u2019s Russia investigation. It is unclear at this point whether Strzok also is considering canceling his appearance.\n\nPage could likewise expect to face a grilling in her committee interview. Page served in the FBI\u2019s office of general counsel, and also served on a brief detail in 2017 on Special Counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s team. Page resigned from the FBI this past May.\n\nPage and Strzok returned to the spotlight last month, upon the release of Justice Department Inspector General Michael E. Horowitz\u2019s long-awaited report on the FBI\u2019s handling of the Clinton email investigation.\n\nThe report included a new text message between the two, where Strzok vowed to \u201cstop\u201d Donald Trump from becoming president.\n\nThe inspector general\u2019s report noted that he was specifically concerned about text messages exchanged between Strzok and Page that \u201cpotentially indicated or created the appearance that investigative decisions were impacted by bias or improper considerations.\u201d\n\nThe inspector general ultimately found no evidence that any anti-Trump bias among several FBI agents made a significant impact on prosecutorial decisions in the Clinton email probe.\n\nLast month, Strzok interviewed before the same committees.\n\n\u201cStrzok was smug, defiant and laughed off a lot of questions,\u201d one congressional source told Fox News after the interview. The source also said Strzok refused to answer some questions on advice of counsel.\n\nAnother source told Fox News that Strzok \u201csaid he regretted sending the texts.\u201d\n\nThe discovery of the anti-Trump messages exchanged with Page ultimately got him booted from Mueller\u2019s team and reassigned to the FBI\u2019s office of human resources. But last month, Strzok was escorted from his FBI office and lost his security clearance.\n\nStrzok\u2019s attorney, Aitan Goelman, has urged the committees to release a transcript of Strzok\u2019s prior closed-door interview to the public.\n\nThe inspector general last month confirmed he was investigating whether any anti-Trump bias from Strzok factored into the launch of the FBI\u2019s Russia investigation.\n\nTrump\u2019s mention of the \u201c13 Angry Democrats\u201d is in reference to attorneys and investigators on Mueller\u2019s team.

After the subject had been in place for a few minutes, the image was imprinted on the plate and could be turned into a photograph using heated mercury vapor. It was then treated with a sodium bithiolate solution and covered with a glass plate to be preserved, Kozachuk explained in her statement.\n\nKozachuk and her team used a technique known as synchrotron technology, while using \"rapid-scanning micro-X-ray fluorescence imaging to analyze the plates.\" They were able to identify where the mercury was on the plates and found that even though the surface had been tarnished, the images were still intact.\n\nCOLONIAL ERA MICHIGAN FORT REVEALS ITS SECRETS\n\n\u201cWe compared degradation that looked like corrosion versus a cloudiness from the residue from products used during the rinsing of the photographs during production versus degradation from the cover glass,\" Ian Coulthard, a co-author on the study, said in a statement. \"When you look at these degraded photographs, you don\u2019t see one type of degradation.\u201d\n\n\"Even though the surface is tarnished, those image particles remain intact,\" study co-researcher Tsun-Kong (T.K.)

The constitutional right to own and carry a firearm sets America apart from the world and puts us ahead of every other nation in terms of individual freedom.\n\nIt is therefore fitting that both sides of the gun issue are voicing some of the clearest comments on President Trump\u2019s nomination Monday of Judge Brett Kavanaugh \u2013 currently serving on the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia \u2013 to become an associate justice of the U.S. Supreme Court.\n\nFormer New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg\u2019s anti-gun rights group, Everytown for Gun Safety, essentially declared this judge would end our civil society, saying it a statement: \u201cJudge Kavanaugh has applied an extreme and dangerous interpretation of the Second Amendment when determining whether a law is constitutional, one that does not take into account a law\u2019s impact on public safety.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, on the pro-freedom side, Lawrence Keane, senior vice president and general counsel of the National Shooting Sports Foundation (NSSF), the trade association for the firearms, said: \u201cWe are confident that Judge Kavanaugh will serve our nation with distinction as an associate justice of our nation\u2019s highest court and that he will make decisions that will serve to protect the Second Amendment and other Constitutionally guaranteed rights of law-abiding Americans.\u201d\n\nWhat other constitutionally protected right is given such a test? Can the government also decide which law-abiding citizens really need their right to free speech or religion? How about who gets due process under the law?\n\nJudge Kavanaugh certainly does offer clarity on this often politically obscured issue. In concise, logical prose Judge Kavanaugh wrote a dissent to a case that followed the U.S. Supreme Court\u2019s 2008 Heller v. D.C. decision, which found the Second Amendment protects an individual\u2019s right to bear arms.\n\nIn this follow-up case, a D.C. U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals panel ruled that Washington, D.C. could ban the possession of most semiautomatic rifles.\n\nJudge Kavanaugh disagreed. He wrote in a dissent: \u201cIn Heller, the Supreme Court held that handguns \u2013 the vast majority of which today are semi-automatic \u2013 are constitutionally protected because they have not traditionally been banned and are in common use by law-abiding citizens. There is no meaningful or persuasive constitutional distinction between semi-automatic handguns and semiautomatic rifles. Semi-automatic rifles, like semi-automatic handguns, have not traditionally been banned and are in common use by law-abiding citizens for self-defense in the home, hunting, and other lawful uses. Moreover, semiautomatic handguns are used in connection with violent crimes far more than semi-automatic rifles are. It follows from Heller\u2019s protection of semi-automatic handguns that semi-automatic rifles are also constitutionally protected and that D.C.\u2019s ban on them is unconstitutional.\u201d\n\nSuch clear and succinct reasoning is precisely what those who would like to reverse the Heller decision and thereby take away our individual right to bear arms fear most.\n\nClear reasoning is, after all, infectious. It carries beyond media filters. When people come across honest and crisp reasoning they stop and think: Oh, I get it now. This is about freedom.\n\nStill, Kavanaugh won\u2019t change the make up on the Supreme Court on the Second Amendment. Retiring Justice Anthony Kennedy voted for an honest reading of the U.S. Constitution, and thereby for freedom in the Heller and 2010 McDonald decisions (both 5-4 votes on the high court).\n\nI\u2019ll never forget the time I sat in the press section in the balcony of the Supreme Court during the Heller hearing. When Justice Kennedy tipped his hand that he reads the Second Amendment to mean what it says, a liberal journalist next me sighed as if in pain: \u201cOh, no.\u201d\n\nYes, oh no, here\u2019s another justice who respects the U.S. Bill of Rights and American freedom.\n\nThis is ever more important today, as the Supreme Court has declined to take another gun-rights case since declaring that the Second Amendment also restricts state and local governments in its McDonald decision.\n\nThe high court even passed on Peruta v. California, a case challenging local restrictions in California that require a person to prove to the local government\u2019s satisfaction that they really need their right to bear arms before the local authorities will allow them to carry a handgun.\n\nWhat other constitutionally protected right is given such a test? Can the government also decide which law-abiding citizens really need their right to free speech or religion? How about who gets due process under the law?\n\nClearly, even if the Heller decision is left alone (anyone who reads the dissents in Heller and McDonald will plainly see the liberal bloc of justices would like to reverse this ruling) there are big questions the Supreme Court will at some point have to answer about our Second Amendment freedoms.\n\nThis makes it very important to have justices who will clearly and honestly interpret the Constitution, like Kavanaugh, on the Supreme Court in this hyper-partisan age.", "authors": ["Frank Miniter"], "url": "http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2018/07/10/kavanaugh-brings-clear-reasoning-to-second-amendment-decisions-thats-why-liberals-are-freaking-out.html"}, {"title": "Trump's Supreme Court pick: Democrats will fight hard to stop Kavanaugh but he has few vulnerabilities", "text": "President Trump may like to spring a surprise on the news media, but with his announcement Monday night for the Supreme Court he went with the safe choice.\n\nHis pick of Brett Kavanaugh, a federal appeals judge in Washington, may have run counter to his instincts against picking inhabitants of the D.C. swamp, or those with deep connections to the Bush administration. But in elevating his reason over his impulses, Trump has picked a nominee who will work to limit the great threat to individual liberty today: the administrative state.\n\nKavanaugh will provide thin gruel for Democratic opponents. He has impeccable credentials: he graduated from Yale College and Law School (where one of us overlapped with him as a student), clerked for two appeals judges, and then the U.S. Supreme Court for the departing Justice Anthony Kennedy.\n\nHe served as a prosecutor on Kenneth G. Starr\u2019s independent counsel investigation into Whitewater (which will twist Democrats demanding Trump\u2019s impeachment into knots), as an associate counsel and then staff secretary in the George W. Bush White House (where we both worked with him), and then as a judge for more than a decade on the D.C. Circuit appeals court.\n\nEven though Democrats will go to any lengths to stop Kavanaugh, he presents them with few vulnerabilities.\n\nHe has written no opinions on their holy-of-holies, abortion or gay marriage. To the extent that he has written on these topics, he has observed that the government might have a compelling interest in providing contraceptives and that an alien might have a due process right to an abortion.\n\nHe has written no major opinions on free speech or religion, nor has he displayed any sympathies for the criminal defense bar.\n\nInstead, Kavanaugh\u2019s creates a deeper challenge to liberalism: rolling back the administrative state.\n\nProgressives have evaded the Constitution\u2019s checks and balances on the federal government by unceasingly expanding its regulatory reach, transferring the actual authority to make the rules from Congress to unelected bureaucrats, and then demanding that judges defer to the results virtually without question.\n\nIt is through this judicial-agency industrial complex where, as the Obama administration displayed on everything from immigration to education to health care, progressives have imposed their views on the American people and the states with little democratic accountability.\n\nKavanaugh has repeatedly challenged the foundations of this runaway state. He has written significant opinions overturning two misbegotten examples of this dynamic.\n\nIn the first, he found the Consumer Finance Protection Board (CFPB) violated the Constitution because it vested all power over consumer finance in the country in one person, but insulated him from removal by the president.\n\nIn the second, he struck down a new federal accounting board, because it too was insulated from presidential control, even though Article II of the Constitution vests the president, and the president alone, with the duty to see that \u201cthe Laws be Faithfully Executed.\u201d\n\nIn both cases, Kavanaugh has made clear that he would put the text and history of the Constitution first, and mistaken precedent second, which should cheer the hearts of conservatives.\n\nLike Justice Neil Gorsuch, Kavanaugh will pursue the administrative state into the weeds. He explained his views at length in a 2010 book review in the Harvard Law Review. Basing his argument on the constitutional separation of powers, he found, unremarkably, that the function of the courts is not to legislate, but to interpret and apply, statutes.\n\nThat is not difficult to do when the statute is clear. But what if it is ambiguous? Under what is known as the \u201cChevron\u201d doctrine, courts have been expected to defer to a reasonable interpretation of the Executive branch agency that administers the statute. Deference is due when a statute is \u201cambiguous,\u201d though not when it is \u201cclear.\u201d\n\nBut, Kavanaugh argued, how are courts to understand the \u201cclear/ambiguous\u201d dichotomy? They must do so in order to give the agency the deference due to it under Chevron. But the dichotomy seems to be more like a gradient than a sharp, bright-line distinction. How much \u201cclarity\u201d does a statute need to be considered \u201cclear\u201d and \u201cunambiguous\u201d?\n\nIn the end, and perhaps surprisingly, Kavanaugh\u2019s critique of Chevron is fundamentally directed against the expansion of executive authority and in favor of broader congressional control.\n\nDemocrats usually present themselves as defenders of Congressional power, in opposition to Republicans, whom they portray as apologists for presidential power.\n\nIf Democratic senators chew on Kavanaugh\u2019s opinions, however, they will find that he would return substantial power to lawmakers, and take it back from bureaucrats managed by the president.\n\nWhat Kavanaugh does not have is a track record on the social and cultural issues that deeply divide the nation.\n\nIf Democratic senators were to put good judicial policy over partisan politics, they would rush to embrace a nominee who has no established positions on abortion, gay marriage, or privacy rights.\n\nThey followed such as strategy to great success with Justices Kennedy and David Souter, who were thought to be conservatives by Presidents Reagan and Bush, but who eventually came to uphold Roe v. Wade and other liberal landmarks.\n\nBut the left wing of the Democratic Party fears that these precedents will fall when Kavanaugh joins the court to form the first five-justice conservative majority in living memory, and will pull out all the stops to prevent it.\n\nIn the end, though, Kavanaugh\u2019s credentials and track record will only make it all the easier for Republicans to confirm him to the Supreme Court and portray his Democratic opponents as obstructionist partisans.\n\nRobert J.

Circuit Judge Brett Kavanaugh to replace retiring Supreme Court Justice Anthony Kennedy, leaving red state Democratic Senators with the dilemma of a lifetime as they approach Kavanaugh\u2019s confirmation hearing: betray Chuck Schumer or betray the voters that put them there.\n\nAny legal expert will tell you that Kavanaugh is deserving of resounding confirmation. In fact, Liberal Yale Law Professor Akhil Amar, who voted for Hillary Clinton in 2016, called President Trump\u2019s entire 25-person Supreme Court nominee list \u201cdistinguished\u201d and \u201cimpressive.\u201d Monday night, in a piece entitled \u201cA Liberal\u2019s Case for Brett Kavanaugh,\u201d Amar wrote: \u201cI strongly supported Hillary Clinton\u2026 [but] it is hard to name anyone with judicial credential as strong as those of Judge Kavanaugh.\u201d thus giving red state Democrats no valid reason to oppose him.\n\nThe Supreme Court has given its stamp of approval to more than a dozen of Kavanaugh\u2019s decisions, and more than 210 judges nationwide have cited his most popular opinions. Perhaps most qualifying of all, though, is this singular sentence written by Kavanaugh: \u201c[R]ead the words of the statute as written. Read the text of the Constitution as written\u2026 Don\u2019t make up new constitutional rights that are not in the text of the Constitution.\u201d\n\nThis incontrovertible statement is precisely the role of a judge and precisely the reason not a single Democrat should oppose the nomination of Judge Kavanaugh, a Constitution-abiding judge with a proven track record.\n\nAs November approaches, it should come as no surprise that these vulnerable red state Democrats are now engaging in some fancy political footwork as they desperately try to convince their constituents that they are Trump allies, despite their proven track record of opposing him.\n\nIf not out of principle, red state Democrats ought to vote for Kavanaugh based on political fate.\n\nTen Democratic senators up for reelection this November hail from states that President Trump won, and in many of them commandingly so.\n\nPresident Trump won Claire McCaskill\u2019s state of Missouri by 19 points; Joe Donnelly\u2019s Indiana by 19 points; Jon Tester\u2019s Montana by 21 points; Heidi Heitkamp\u2019s North Dakota by 36 points; and Joe Manchin\u2019s West Virginia by an eye-opening 42 points.\n\nIn each of these states, voters sent an unmistakable message to their elected officials: We support President Trump and his agenda. And yet, in each of these states, their senators talk like Donald Trump \u2013 but vote like Chuck Schumer.\n\nAs November approaches, it should come as no surprise that these vulnerable red state Democrats are now engaging in some fancy political footwork as they desperately try to convince their constituents that they are Trump allies, despite their proven track record of opposing him.\n\nWith a vacancy on the Supreme Court and Majority Leader Mitch McConnell planning a Senate confirmation vote this fall, these faux Trump-supporting Democratic senators now have the opportunity to put their money where their mouth is and vote for President Trump\u2019s highly qualified nominee, Brett Kavanaugh.\n\nOpposing Kavanaugh is fraught with political risks. Voting against Kavanaugh will undoubtedly open Democrats up to attacks from Republican opponents \u2013 attacks like those we\u2019ve already seen in Missouri, where Republican opponent Josh Hawley calls out Democratic Senator Claire McCaskill in a new ad over the upcoming Supreme Court vote.\n\nAs a confirmation vote on Kavanaugh approaches, every red state Democrat will be forced to answer the following question: are you Trump allies in word or in action?\n\nSenator Jon Tester recently took out a full page ad in 14 Montana newspapers thanking President Trump and touting \u201cJon\u2019s 16 bills signed into law by President Trump\u201d (this despite his vote against tax cuts and against Supreme Court Justice Neil Gorsuch).\n\nWill Jon Tester\u2019s words be followed by action?\n\nSenator Joe Manchin of West Virginia renounced his support for Hillary Clinton and said he would be \u201copen\u201d to voting for Trump in 2020.\n\nWill Joe Manchin\u2019s words be followed by action?\n\nSenator Joe Donnelly brags that he voted with Trump more than every other Democratic senator with just two exceptions (keep in mind they all voted against tax cuts and permitted the government to shut down).\n\nWill Joe Donnelly\u2019s words be followed by action?\n\nTime will tell.\n\nIf these vulnerable Democrats do vote for Kavanaugh, they are sure to provoke the ire of the Democratic leadership. Asked about red state Democrats losing elections because of their votes against the nominee, Minority Whip Dick Durbin flatly stated: \u201cThey understand it\u2019s an historic decision. It\u2019s about more than the next election.\u201d\n\nIn essence, Durbin is perversely suggesting that these red state Democrats put party before people \u2013 the very people that made them United States Senators.\n\nTen Senate Democrats \u2013 Claire McCaskill, Heidi Heitkamp, Bill Nelson, Sherrod Brown, Bob Casey, Tammy Baldwin, Debbie Stabenow, Jon Tester, Joe Manchin, and Joe Donnelly \u2013 will have to make the choice to stand with Chuck Schumer or to stand with the people of their great states.\n\nPeople over party should be the easy answer.", "authors": ["Kayleigh Mcenany"], "url": "http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2018/07/09/kavanaughs-nomination-leaves-red-state-democrats-with-dilemma-lifetime-betray-their-party-or-voters.html"}, {"title": "Doug Schoen: On Kavanaugh, red state Democrats face a 'nightmare decision'", "text": "Monday night, President Trump announced Brett Kavanaugh as his nominee to replace Justice Anthony Kennedy, who announced his retirement late last month.\n\nWithin hours of the announcement, protestors arrived at the steps of the Supreme Court building in Washington, D.C., to protest the new nominee.\n\nDemocrats across the country, particularly those in traditionally red states, are facing what Senator Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., has called a \u201cnightmare decision.\u201d\n\nHere is the tough decision those red state Democrats have to make: Either go along with the rest of the Democratic party to oppose the nominee and risk losing their own upcoming election, or support Kavanaugh and leave the Democrats short of the votes they may need.\n\nKavanaugh is perceived by many analysts to be less staunchly conservative than other judges on President Trump\u2019s short list. Yet, on issues such as gun control and religious liberty, Kavanaugh would very likely side with the more conservative justices on the Court.\n\nThis dichotomy is what leaves Democrats running for reelection in red states with the tough choice.\n\nGiven that the Democratic party is already fractured and in a state of chaos, Democratic senators aren\u2019t necessarily bound by one single ideology. For this reason, I expect many of them to vote in favor of the Republican nominee.\n\nNow more than ever, Democrats must recognize that although we are in an age of political polarization, voting across party lines might actually benefit the party itself.\n\nMoreover, Kavanaugh has made it clear he will follow precedent on prior Supreme Court rulings. When Senator Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., asked about his views on Roe v. Wade during his 2006 D.C. Circuit confirmation hearing, Kavanaugh responded, \u201cif confirmed to the D.C. Circuit, I would follow Roe v. Wade faithfully and fully. That would be binding precedent of the court. It's been decided by the Supreme Court. ... I'm saying if I were confirmed to the D.C. Circuit, senator, I would follow it. It's been reaffirmed many times.\"\n\nHis affirmation of following precedent perhaps makes red state Democrats view him as less dangerous to the party\u2019s platform, and therefore easier to justify confirming to their Democratic base.\n\nHis support of legal precedent provides Democrats with some hope that he may support gay rights, abortion rights, and other liberal causes.\n\nFor these red state Democrats, confirming Kavanaugh could even garner them some Republican-leaning votes in their own states.\n\nThere is also the possibility, though, that far-left Democrats from deep blue states would condemn those senators who vote to confirm Kavanaugh, leading to an even greater divide within the Democratic party.\n\nIf Democrats stand firm on opposing any Trump nominee, however, they run the risk of losing seats and perhaps even the chance of regaining a majority.\n\nUltimately, this is a lose-lose situation.\n\nIn 2017, when Neil Gorsuch faced confirmation for Justice Scalia\u2019s seat, three Democrats voted yes: Joe Manchin, Joe Donnelly, and Heidi Heitkamp. Manchin represents West Virginia, Donnelly represents Indiana, and Heitkamp North Dakota.\n\nAll three are up for re-election in historically red states that Trump won easily. It behooves these three Democrats to once again vote across the aisle for their own sake to keep their Senate seats. Voting against Kavanaugh could very well give their Republican challengers the support they need to vote them out of office.\n\nAs an example, during the 2017 Gorsuch confirmation process, Democratic Senator Claire McCaskill of Missouri agonized before ultimately voting against him. Tellingly, her approval rating dropped by the year\u2019s end in a state that President Trump won by a 20-point margin. Her opponent in this year\u2019s election, Josh Hawley, has already released an ad saying McCaskill wants \u201cliberals\u201d on the Supreme Court.\n\nAs a Democrat running for reelection in a solid red state, McCaskill does not have the same freedom to oppose Kavanaugh with an election only months away.\n\nThe truth is, even if every Democrat votes against Kavanaugh, he will still be confirmed if no Republican votes against him.

She insisted Moore never lost his charm, even as he was battling cancer.\n\nPHOTOS: ROGER MOORE'S 'BOND' GIRLS\n\n\u201cDad was such a kind man and had a wonderful sense of humor,\u201d said the 54-year-old, Moore's first child with Italian actress Luisa Mattioli.\n\n\u201cEven when he was in [the] hospital in his last days, he had a twinkle in his eye, and you could see him flirting with the nurses. I\u2019d have to say \u2018Dad, behave!\u2019\u201d\n\nToday, Deborah still has fond memories of growing up with the Hollywood star. She described how even when Moore was at the height of his fame, family always came first.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019d usually take us on film sets with him when he was working because, being such a family man, he didn\u2019t want us to be split up,\" she said. \"As we were quite young \u2013 I was 10 when he got Bond \u2013 we were taken out of school for a few months and a tutor would come with us so we didn\u2019t miss out on class. I remember when we went to Jamaica to film Bond \u2013 it was all very exciting.\u201d\n\nMoore didn\u2019t think twice when it came to welcoming his children into his star-studded world of filmmaking. But, when cameras stopped rolling, he preferred to dedicate his time to them.\n\n\u201cHis favorite thing to do with us when we were young was to take us swimming, especially when we went out to Italy, where my mother was from,\u201d said Deborah. \u201cIt was right by the sea, so every morning we\u2019d get up at the crack of dawn together and go out for a swim. It was wonderful.\u201d\n\nJAMES BOND IS BACK: DANIEL CRAIG TEAMS UP WITH DIRECTOR DANNY BOYLE FOR HIS 5TH '007' MOVIE\n\nMoore also taught his children the importance of giving back to those in need.\n\n\u201cHe first got involved in UNICEF through his close friend, Audrey Hepburn, because he admired the work she did with them,\u201d said Deborah. \u201cSo he went along to a UNICEF conference with her and immediately decided he wanted to be a part of it. He cared hugely about what was happening in the world and got very upset about injustices, particularly towards women and children.\u201d\n\nWith the help of UNICEF, the goodwill ambassador traveled the world for over 26 years to champion children\u2019s rights. In 1999, he was made a Commander of the British Empire and was knighted in 2003.\n\nThen in 2012, he raised more than $1 million for the organization by leading a Bond-themed auction. That same year, he received the first UNICEF UK Lifetime Achievement Award.\n\n\u201cHe actually turned down a lot of work because of his UNICEF commitments,\u201d said Deborah. \u201cHe even used to get a little bit annoyed when he went on talk shows and found it hard to get around to talking about the charity. He\u2019d always come away and say, \u2018Oh I wish I\u2019d had more time to talk about UNICEF.\u2019\u201d\n\nAnd throughout his life, Moore never took his fame for granted, a lesson he was determined to teach his daughter, also an actress.\n\n\u201cDad taught me to always be appreciative of what you have,\u201d said Deborah. \u201cIn fact, he would never say no to anyone who asked for an autograph. Even if it was at the most inconvenient moment, he\u2019d be so gracious and say yes.\n\n\"I remember he once said, \u2018These are the people who put me here\u2019 and that\u2019s why he did it. He also taught me that it\u2019s so easy to be kind and so hard to be unkind, because he always had so much love and respect for other people. He was such a good man.\u201d\n\nDeborah would go on to launch her own successful career as an actress. She even appeared in the 2002 Bond film \u201cDie Another Day,\u201d opposite Pierce Brosnan as 007.\n\nThe publication noted that as a child, she joined her father onscreen when she made her acting debut in an episode of \u201cThe Persuaders!\u201d in 1971.\n\n\u201cThey needed a little girl to be in this episode and so I was taken out of school for the day to come and film with him,\u201d she explained. \u201cIt was great and by then I definitely had the acting bug.\u201d\n\nShortly before his death, Moore published \u201c\u00c0 Bient\u00f4t,\u201d where he looked back at his life and the memories that continued to shape him. Deborah wrote the foreword but didn\u2019t read the book until after Moore passed away.\n\n\u201cI sort of knew he was writing a book before he died but I didn\u2019t read any of it until a few months afterward,\u201d she explained. \u201cThe first time I read it in full I could just hear him talking. I was on the train home from visiting a friend of dad\u2019s. And as I was reading the last chapter where he talks about the friends he lost and about death, I just couldn\u2019t stop crying. It\u2019s a really difficult bit to read because dad didn\u2019t think he was ever going to die. We all thought he was going to get better like he had done the last time he was doing poorly, so it came as a terrible shock when he passed away.\n\n\u201cSince he died, I find there are moments when I\u2019m fine and then I go, \u2018Oh I must ring dad\u2019 and realize I can\u2019t,\" she added. \"All my life I was a daddy\u2019s girl and dreaded the day I\u2019d lose him. I often said to him, \u2018I hope something happens to me before you because I don\u2019t think I could live in this world without you.'\n\n\"So I was scared when I realized he wouldn\u2019t survive this awful illness, that I was going to become a mess. But I\u2019ve since found an inner strength and I feel like dad\u2019s gone to a better place, with his mates up in the heavens. Now I have pictures of him everywhere and I always feel like dad is sat on my shoulder helping me out.\u201d\n\nWhen Deborah was asked how she felt her father would want to be remembered, her answer was simple.\n\n\u201cI think he\u2019d want to be remembered for trying his best in everything he did,\u201d she said. \u201cFor trying to make the world a better place and for making people smile.\u201d", "authors": ["Stephanie Nolasco"], "url": "http://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/2018/07/10/roger-moores-daughter-shares-memories-growing-up-with-james-bond-star.html"}, {"title": "Jada Pinkett Smith reveals sex addiction problem when she was younger", "text": "Jada Pinkett Smith spoke about her previous struggles with several addictions, including sex, on her new show.\n\nIn Monday night\u2019s episode of \u201cRed Table Talk,\u201d Smith said she \u201chad a sex addiction of some kind.\u201d\n\n\u201cMy sort of addictions jump.

And in the latest episode of \"Fixer Upper: Behind the Design,\" we get a master class in how to pull it off!\n\nIn the \"Herrera House\" episode, we meet punk rocker Mike Herrera, of the MxPx band, and his wife, Holli, who are moving from Washington state back to Holli's native Waco, TX, to be closer to her family. They've found a sweet three-bedroom, two-bath home built in 1910 located in the historic district, and they're in love.\n\nWhen chatting with the Herreras about the style they want for their new home, Holli says the first thing that \"spoke to her\" when they entered was the vintage farmhouse feel. So Joanna makes sure to keep that theme alive while redecorating, while giving it a fresh, modern vibe.\n\nTo pull that off, Chip and Jo pass along some killer tips that we can all use in our own abodes to add a little modern farmhouse style ... or a lot.\n\nAdd shiplap\n\nMost people didn't even know what shiplap was until Joanna made it her signature design move, using the horizontally (or vertically) interlocking boards liberally in nearly every home she and Chip touched in \"Fixer Upper.\" And this time, Joanna takes it to a whole new level, recycling the original shiplap in the 108-year-old house and adding lots of new wood, putting it in almost every room. It even goes on the ceiling\u2014the vintage wood shiplap overhead warms up the black-and-white room like nothing else can, she explains.\n\nDon't ignore history\n\nIn their effort to modernize the old farmhouse, Joanna recognizes a few features that should be preserved rather than removed. They include the moldings, the fireplaces, and even \"that built-in in the kitchen.\" She's referring to a dish hutch made of oak, with glass doors. They will refinish it and keep it exactly where it is, but she'll add patterned floor tile from elsewhere in the home as a backsplash. Genius!\n\nBlend old with new\n\nThis is easy for Joanna. She's done it a hundred times.\n\n\"The ways we've done that in the past is to complement classic farmhouse features like shiplap and neutral colors but also add modern features like black iron, slick light features, and maybe some concrete.\" (More on concrete next...)\n\nTry concrete rather than tile in the bathroom\n\nWho says bathrooms have to be all tile, all the time? Joanna has her crew pour a concrete shower floor, and gives the shower walls of glass. They also create concrete countertops. She warms up the room with blond wood cabinets. We're thinking the lack of grouting will make it easy to clean, and since this bathroom will be mostly used by the kids, it's about as practical as you can get.\n\nAdd rugs and paint over concrete to warm up the floor\n\nYet concrete, though modern, can soak up stains\u2014as Chip and Joanna find out while turning the home's detached garage into Mike's studio so he can rehearse all he wants without disturbing the family. Even an acid wash won't remove the oil stains from generations of cars, so Chip and Jo simply paint over it, using a warm gray color, and make it even cozier with an area rug. Perfection!\n\nMultiply lights for free\n\nThis is so simple, yet so genius, you'll wonder why you didn't think of it before. Joanna hangs two modern pendant lights in the bathroom, right in front of the wall-to-wall mirror. Surprise! The reflection makes it look like she's hung four lights, and doubles the amount of illumination.\n\nPick a number\n\nYou've seen Joanna use family initials many times in her designs, but this may be the first time she's incorporated a lucky number. The number 9 has a special significance to the Herreras; it shows up in the birthdays of their two children, and in many other instances throughout their lives together. So Joanna uses it as a recurring design feature, making the home even more personal for the Herreras.\n\nThe post Joanna Gaines Reveals Easy Ways to Add 'Modern Farmhouse' Flair to Any Home appeared first on Real Estate News & Insights | realtor.com\u00ae.", "authors": [], "url": "http://www.foxnews.com/real-estate/2018/07/10/joanna-gaines-reveals-7-easy-ways-to-add-modern-farmhouse-flair-to-any-home.html"}, {"title": "New Sacha Baron Cohen series a Hollywood hit job on GOP, source says", "text": "Showtime announced Sacha Baron Cohen's satirical seven-episode \u201cWho is America?\u201d will premiere this Sunday, exploring \"the diverse individuals ... across the political and cultural spectrum, who populate our unique nation.\u201d\n\nHowever, a source familiar with the project \u2013 who viewed parts of the series in its early, rough-cut stage during a private screening at Sony Studios in Los Angeles on March 22 \u2013 told Fox News that, at least then, it was nothing more than a Hollywood hit job on Trump supporters and the Republican Party.\n\n\u201cThey actually tried to screen out the Republicans,\u201d the insider revealed. \u201cCohen went undercover to nail Republicans. Total hit piece on Dick Cheney, Sherriff Joe, Roy Moore and others. None of these people seemed to know they were duped. Total secret.\u201d\n\nThe source also noted that the setup was \u201cso over-the-top\u201d and that those involved in the project were seemingly \u201ctrolling online for far-right people to interact with and [getting material for] more setups for future episodes.\u201d\n\n\u201cI couldn\u2019t believe how unbelievably partisan it is,\u201d the insider said. \u201cThey also interviewed Bernie Sanders but didn\u2019t mock him at all. The crazy right-wing character was interviewing him with a bunch of stupid statistics that made no sense and he also did the same thing with Ted Koppel. The truth is, Sacha is really funny and good at what he does.\u201d\n\nA \u201cfake website\u201d was presumably also set up in connection to the series and one of Cohen's characters is featured in a draft-cut promo.\n\nThe site, rife with spelling errors, denotes on its homepage:\n\n\u201cREJECT THE MAINSTREME MEDIA + THE LIEbrary OF FALSE INFOMATION THEY TRY TO PUSH INTO THE PUBLICS MIND'S. THE TRUTHBRARY WILL SET YOU FREE. THIS IS A LIBERTY WEBSITE FOR TRUE AMERICA AND TRUTH LOVING AMERICANS.\u201d\n\nThe site bills itself as \u201ca collection of studies and investigations carried out by Dr. Billy Wayne Ruddick for the good of the American people.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe must stand together to fight the dark forces of clintons and muslims and Godless peoples to stand strong for our religious freedom and hold forth for what is right in our country,\u201d it continues. \u201cNow is the time for the silent majority to come together ansd [sic] seek out our truth.\u201d\n\nThe posts include \u201cObama is a kenyan,\u201d \u201cGermans now living under Shari\u2019ah law,\u201d \u201cSigns that Hollywood is RUN by the SATANIC ELITE,\u201d and the implication that \u201cthe military has been implanting mind controlled neural dust to remotely control their victims.\u201d\n\nCohen apparently plays a multitude of characters, including \u201cDr. Billy\u201d (as per the website) with Sanders. He plays a German homosexual with Sheriff Joe and an Israeli Mossad agent with Cheney and two other Georgia GOP-ers who were \u201cbeing taught how to stop a shooter in the workplace.\u201d In early clips at least, the comedian also went \u201cundercover\u201d at the Women\u2019s March.\n\n\u201cThe show is an exaggerated account of the perceived paranoia and all the hate the left thinks people on the right have towards so many groups,\u201d claimed the viewer. \u201cI think they threw Bernie in there just to have a cover so they can\u2019t be accused of it being a total right-wing hit job.\u201d\n\nWhether or not any such scenes made the final cut, remains to be seen.\n\nAnother source connected to the project told Fox News that the series has been in the works for some time, at least one year, and even those associated with it have not yet seen the full series or been given much information, insisting that the whole project has been kept tightly under lock and key.\n\nRepresentatives for Sony declined to comment, and reps for Cohen and Showtime did not immediately respond to Fox News' requests for comment.\n\nCohen, most famous for his characters \u201cBorat\u201d and \u201cAli-G,\u201d is the writer and director behind the forthcoming series. It is his first TV show in over a decade.\n\n\u201cSacha is a comedic genius who shocks you with his audacity, bravery and inventiveness,\u201d Showtime Networks president/CEO David Nevins stated in the network\u2019s press release.\n\n\u201cHe is the premier provocateur of our time, but not for the sake of \u2018gotcha\u2019 moments. Behind the elaborate setup is a genuine quest for the truth about people, places and politics. Nobody knows how to cause a stir like Sacha Baron Cohen, and it\u2019s going to be fascinating to watch what happens when \u2018Who is America?\u2019 is released on the world.\u201d\n\nAn online promo featuring Cohen concludes with the tagline \u201cSacha graduates.

It just melted away, because the blood, the relationship between brother and sister, the bond, is so deep\u2026 She broke down and said '\u2026 We have to be OK with each other. It\u2019s the foundation.'\u201d\n\nCarrie died in 2016 at age 60 after suffering from a heart attack on a flight from London to Los Angeles. Their mother died just a day later at age 84 from a stroke.\n\nFisher, determined to keep the legacies of the two women alive, recently published a memoir titled \u201cMy Girls.\u201d He revealed the writing process helped him cope with the loss.\n\n\u201c... Losing a mother and a sister so close together, it\u2019s devastating,\u201d he explained. \u201cI think what was even more heartbreaking was the effect that it had on my niece. Watching the side effects of it are also very difficult\u2026 [But] looking at my mother in particular, she would be furious if you were to go into depression and just become a recluse. She would want you to step out of it.\"\n\n\u201cNow of course, everybody needs to deal with it,\" added Fisher. \"I\u2019m a Christian. I happen to believe that we\u2019ll all meet again\u2026 My mother was a Christian. She believed that. Carrie believed it. We\u2019ll all meet again\u2026 Also, [Carrie] visits me in my dreams, and I appreciate that, too\u2026 It was very cathartic, writing the book. It was heartbreaking\u2026 But I had to do it. Without Carrie there to write all the family stories, I\u2019m the last man standing. If something happened to me, those stories would be lost.\u201d\n\nOne of the misconceptions Fisher wanted to address in his book was his mother\u2019s final moments. Reports insisted Reynolds broke down and died from a broken heart after her daughter\u2019s death. But Fisher said his mother was always determined to be by her daughter\u2019s side.\n\n\u201cShe [said], \u2018I really need to be with her,\u2019\u201d Fisher recalled. \u201c\u2018I miss her.\u2019 In effect, she closed her eyes within moments of that and just went to sleep and never woke up. It was a beautiful exit, in many ways, and it was\u2026 I think it was almost a gift to me.\n\n\"Nobody wants to see a bad exit\u2026 Also, it was her mission in life always to look after Carrie. Carrie was a bit more needy than me. I was brought onto this Earth to be Carrie\u2019s companion\u2026 Literally, I was brought here so Carrie wouldn\u2019t be alone. My mother went with her in the end, where I could not go, so she would not be alone.\u201d\n\nFisher insisted Reynolds was always protective of her little girl, especially when Carrie embarked on what would quickly become a thriving acting career. When Carrie first appeared in the 1975 film \u201cShampoo\u201d opposite Warren Beatty, it was Reynolds who stepped in.\n\n\u201cCarrie got this little part, and she plays a teenager,\u201d explained Fisher. \u201cWarren Beatty, effectively, ends up sleeping with her, and Carrie has to use the F-word to him. My mother saw the script early on and was like, \u2018No, no, no. You\u2019re not gonna drop the F-bomb in your first movie on TV. I\u2019ve never used the F-word, and I\u2019ve been doing this for years. So Carrie was like, \u2018No, I have to do this. I wanna\u2026 I don\u2019t care.\u2019\u201d\n\nReynolds attempted to convince Beatty to change the word to \u201cscrew\u201d in the script, but the actor, who was eager to shock audiences, declined. Fisher wouldn\u2019t know what happened next until Beatty, now 81, told him about a year ago.\n\n\u201cHe said, \u2018Your mother looked at me, and she said, \u2018If you touch my daughter, I will have you 86ed \u2014 you know, eight miles out, six feet down.\u2019 He knew what that meant, \u2018cause that was the old mafia term... He was like, \u2018No problem, Debbie.\u2019 And he never touched Carrie.\u201d\n\nBut while Reynolds was attempting to protect Carrie from the wilds of Hollywood, Fisher was having his own fun. He claimed actor Tony Curtis became his pot dealer at one point when the family was living in New York City.\n\n\u201cHe had just moved in, and he was showing us around the house,\u201d said Fisher. \u201cI had just gotten to town and, being a teenager, he assumed that Carrie and I were smoking a little pot\u2026 So he puts his arm around me and he goes, \u2018Hey, man.\u2019 Puts a couple joints in my pocket, and he goes, \u2018Don\u2019t go to strangers.\u2019\n\n\"I\u2019d only known him from the movies. I was a little kid when he made the movie \u2018The Rat Race\u2019 with my mother, and nobody was even thinking in these terms\u2026 At that moment, my mother didn\u2019t know Carrie and I were smoking pot at all. He was even kind of hiding it from her. So it was a little bit of a revelation.\u201d\n\nReynolds also wasn\u2019t aware of the romance Carrie, then 19, had developed with Harrison Ford, who was in his 30s, while they both filmed \u201cStar Wars,\u201d which premiered in 1977.\n\n\u201cThey had an impetuous affair and I was aware of it \u2014 not in any huge detail because it wasn\u2019t that big of a thing,\u201d said Fisher. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t like it was such an ongoing thing. But Carrie had sworn me to secrecy on it, and no one had ever said anything to my mother.\u201d\n\nReynolds wouldn\u2019t know about the relationship until decades later, when she read Carrie\u2019s personal journals, which were stored in the family archives, to help her daughter write \u201cThe Princess Diarist\u201d in 2016.

The non-profit was founded in 2011 by chain restaurant Golden Corral.\n\n\u201cMy father, who was in the Marines in WWI, told me to always help other people if I could,\u201d Turner recalled.\n\nHe said having a big heart runs in the family \u2013 a quality that nurse Lyuri Hardishek spotted, even in one of Turner\u2019s most difficult periods.\n\nHardishek said \u201cit became really apparent that he had no support system\u201d and that his PTSD had essentially paralyzed him.\n\nSo, 20 years ago, Turner and Hardishek unofficially adopted each other as family.\n\nHardishek has watched Turner's life transform over the past two decades. While PTSD will always impact him, Hardishek said chores, exercises and volunteer work have allowed Turner to regain control of his life.\n\n\u201cIn the beginning, I never thought I\u2019d take such good care of him, that we\u2019d be doing so well at this point,\u201d she chuckled.\n\nGreeted by a standing ovation, Turner visited a Camp Corral site in Georgia for the first time this summer, armed with stories and smiles.\n\nIn the past five years, he helped his Disabled American Veterans chapter raise $26,000 for the Just Be Kids campaign. Those donations pour into Camp Corral, funding nearly 40 campers and even earning Turner an honorary cabin.\n\n\u201cWith our partners at Golden Corral, the work disabled veterans like Mr. Turner are doing gives children who share the burdens of our national defense an opportunity to just be kids and connect with others who share their experiences,\u201d said Bryan Lett, a spokesperson for DAV.\n\nWhile riding on the back of a golf cart, Turner waved to kids emerging from their cabins as their rest period ended.\n\nKids shouted, \u201cThank you for your service\u201d and \u201cHi, Mr. Turner.\u201d\n\nSmile and wave. Smile and wave. Turner was a Camp Corral celebrity.\n\n\u201cIt was a rare moment for these kids to celebrate him,\u201d camp coordinator Dorcas Tomasek said. \u201cI can\u2019t even put words into it. It was really a powerful moment.\u201d\n\nTomasek has been involved in camps for nearly three decades.

Turner called them the forgotten victims of war, which is why the non-profit\u2019s mission resonated so deeply with him.\n\nBut the kids are not the only ones reaping the benefits of Turner\u2019s hard work.\n\nIt\u2019s a full circle \u2013 Turner providing opportunities to campers like Simone and campers enlivening Turner.\n\nHardishek said since visiting the campsite, Turner has referenced his experience frequently \u2013 pulling him out of the hovering darkness from PTSD and giving him a rejuvenated purpose, a broader smile and even more pride in being an American.\n\n\u201cHe made a comment to me about a year ago.

Nearly 40% of small businesses close after a disaster, according to the Federal Emergency Management Agency.\n\nAnd if a storm shutters a small business, there's a good chance it stays shuttered for good. Only 25% of businesses that close due to a major disaster ever reopen, according to the Institute for Business & Home Safety.\n\nAlthough those statistics are admittedly bleak, it's not impossible to weather a terrible storm.\n\nIrma: An Unwanted Visitor\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"It's all about having a plan,\" said Roberto Torres, owner of Black & Denim, a boutique clothing store with 3 locations in Tampa.\n\nTorres was one of the thousands of small business owners who found themselves in the crosshairs of Hurricane Irma as the storm made landfall in Florida on September 10, 2017.\n\nAlthough Torres had an emergency plan ready to go, he was hopeful he wouldn't need it. \"They were saying it was going to turn and go out the Atlantic,\" Torres added. \"But as the storm neared, the track changed and we knew that wasn't going to happen.\"\n\nIn Miami, restaurateur Graziano Sbroggio was also hoping for the best but preparing for the worst. As the owner of 7 restaurants, including Spris Pizzeria, a hotspot in Miami Beach, he survived Hurricane Andrew in 1992, and knew preparation would be critical. \"We prepared as much as we could,\" he said.\n\nMeanwhile, the Columbia Restaurant Group also rapidly put its contingency storm plans in place. \"With the hurricane spanning the width of Florida, all 13 of our restaurants were in harm\u2019s way,\" explained Michael Kilgore, the firm's Marketing Director. \"Our executive team was meeting daily to monitor developments and to tweak our plan on the fly.\"\n\nAbout 48 hours ahead of impact, all of these small business owners - and many others - shifted into high gear.\n\nKnowing their human resources were their most valuable resources, they all made the welfare of their employees priority one. We implemented an internal communications tree,\" Kilgore explained, for efficient and fast messaging before, during and after the storm.\n\nThe owners also gathered supplies needed to secure their businesses.\n\nBecause two of his stores are located in Tampa's historic district, Torres knew the panes of his windows were a top priority. Too fragile to withstand hurricane force winds, he spent a lot of time and money boarding up the glass.\n\nSbroggio took down awnings, and brought everything inside that wasn't bolted down. \"I've done this before, and in the days before a hurricane, everyone lends a hand.\" The restaurant owners also tested their generators, critical in the event of a power outage.\n\nAs the storm approached, the atmosphere grew tense. Everyone closed well in advance of landfall, and as the hour of impact drew near, these small business owners hunkered down in their homes with family and friends. \"That's all we could do.\" Torres said.\n\nThe Moment Arrives\n\nFor much of Florida, the worst of the storm hit Sunday night and early Monday morning. At the storm's midpoint, Sbroggio spoke of an eerie quiet interrupted by the sounds of tornado alarms. Torres remembered tree limbs from high above snapping and crashing to the ground.\n\nAlthough some small businesses were devastated by Irma, the preparation and the prayers paid off for these entrepreneurs. The biggest challenge for all of them involved downed power lines and the impact of not having electricity for several days.\n\nFor Graziano Sbroggio and the Columbia Restaurant Group, those generators tested ahead of the storm powered refrigerators that prevented food from going bad. Food costs can be one of the most difficult costs to manage in the best of weather, let alone a hurricane.\n\nAt Black & Denim power loss shuttered stores for 3 days. \"In the end we lost thousands of dollars in sales,\" Torres admitted, \u201cBut nothing that couldn't be managed. I feel like we dodged a bullet.\"\n\nThe Lesson\n\nAccording to FEMA, out of 859 businesses that responded to the Florida Economic Opportunity Department survey, 724 (84.3%) small businesses lost sales due to Hurricane Irma, with 208 (24.2%) unable to open their primary business location, at least temporarily.\n\nWhen asked how they were able to make it through the storm relatively unscathed, Graziano Sbroggio, Roberto Torres and Michael Kilgore, all agreed that the plans they made long before the storm ever appeared on any radar screen played a central role in their success.\n\n\"We were very fortunate,\" said Kilgore, who recommended small businesses make a checklist so every action that needs to be taken before a storm is spelled out clearly. It also ensures small but important details are not overlooked.\n\n\"Carry the proper insurance and keep important documents accessible,\" said Torres, who felt insurance provided him with some peace of mind.\n\n\"Also keep cash handy,\" Sbroggio added. \"And of course, pray!\"\n\nLee Howard is a freelance writer who has been covering finance, consumer and business news for more than 20 years.

The mad minds at Honda UK are aiming for something higher, though: 150 mph.\n\nOriginally, when the company revealed the Mean Mower V2 in March, Honda UK said the hopped-up grass cutter could do 134 mph, but further testing shows it's capable of higher speeds.

Read on to keep your grass looking its best.\n\nBest time to mow a lawn\n\nChoose your mowing time wisely: Debra Morrow, Vice President of Marketing at ArtisTree Landscape Maintenance & Design in Venice, Fla., suggests waiting to mow until after the dew has dried, but before the heat of the day sets in. This prevents the mower from slipping and sliding on the wet grass, but protects you from the heat. If you're not able to mow in mid-morning, a second choice is late afternoon, when temperatures start to cool.\n\nWhatever the time of day, never mow grass when it's wet. Not only do you risk slipping while mowing after a rainstorm, but mowing on a sodden lawn can leave unsightly ruts. What's more, wet clippings are a pain to clean up, Milotte says, and clumps of grass on your lawn could smother new sprouts.\n\nHow often to mow a lawn\n\nMowing once a week every Saturday might work at some times during the growing season, but when your grass is popping up at an exponential rate, you just can't wait, says Damon Millotte, General Manager and Vice President at Tailor Made Lawns in North Carolina. Instead of a mowing schedule, he recommends mowing based on the height of the grass.\n\nGenerally, three to three and a half inches is an accepted height for most grasses. However, each grass type has an ideal height, says Morrow. When you get seed for your lawn, the bag should tell you the optimal height to mow. A good rule of thumb is to mow when the grass is one-third higher than the recommended mowing height. If you didn't seed your lawn, you can check Scotts' grass guide to determine which kind you have growing in your yard and the recommended mowing height.\n\nAlso keep in mind that the growth rate varies as well\u2014for instance, based on the type of fertilizer you're using (nitrogen-heavy fertilizers make grass grow faster), the time of year (cool-season grasses grow quickly in fall and spring, warm-season grasses grow fastest in summer), and how much water your lawn is getting.\n\nHow to mow a lawn\n\n\"There's not one best way to mow,\" says Millotte. \"Some people like to cut neat rows back and forth across their lawn, some people like to try a spiral, and other people will just tackle a section at a time.\"\n\nThat said, there are a few tricks to mowing your lawn that the experts swear by.\n\nAvoid overmowing: Shorter grass means less mowing, right? Not exactly. \"We advise against cutting more than one-third of the grass leaf at a time,\" Morrow says. \"Your lawn will need less water, be more resistant to weeds and have a deeper, greener color. Mowing your grass too short just stresses your grass and invites pests and diseases. Mowing at the proper height allows it to develop deeper roots to withstand dry spells.\"\n\nBut don't wait too long: Can your lawn get a sunburn? You'd better believe it! \"When blades are tall, they naturally shade the bottom,\" Millotte explains. \"Then, when you finally cut it, that lower part of the grass gets scorched by sudden sun exposure.\"\n\nVary the direction each time you mow: \"If you cut your lawn in the same pattern, your grass slowly starts to lean in that direction,\" Millotte explains. \"If you switch it up, it can prevent ruts from forming and give you a lawn that stands more upright.\"\n\nCheck your mower blade: \"A sharp blade gives you an even mow and leaves your grass at the same height, but when you start noticing patches that you have to go over again, it's a good sign that you need to start thinking about replacing the blade,\" says Butch Dellis of Nutri-Green Tulsa in Tulsa, Okla. You can also take a look a the grass blades themselves. Dull mower blades won't slice your grass clean across the top; they'll tear it.\n\n\"If you're still not sure, you can inspect the blade itself,\" Dellis says. \"Most people who mow their lawn with regularity need to have the blade sharpened once each season. Large nicks or dents in the blade or areas where the blade is wearing thin can mean that you'll need to get the blade replaced, not just sharpened.\"\n\nYour local mower shop will be able to tell you if your mower blade can simply be sharpened or if you need to buy a new one. Sharpening typically costs about $5 to $10, while a new blade can cost closer to $20.\n\nThe article originally appeared on Realtor.com.", "authors": [], "url": "http://www.foxnews.com/real-estate/2018/07/10/right-way-to-mow-your-lawn.html"}, {"title": "Live out your Bilbo Baggins fantasies in this Alaskan 'Hobbit House'", "text": "This intriguing home in Wasilla, AK, looks like it's arrived straight from the Shire. Built into the surrounding hillside, it has a sod roof covered in trees.

The torvak, or sod roof, was the common way to construct roofs for timbered houses in Scandinavia up to the end of the 19th century.\n\nSimilar to raising a barn, the community would come together to cut pieces of sod from nearby meadows, then place them on top of birch bark roofing.\n\nUnlike the green roofs of today, which use only a few plant species, these roofs were biodiverse and self-sustaining. They could last for up to 30 years, providing a habitat and food for local pollinators. This kind of roofing, along with earth on all sides of the home, also provides crucial insulation to withstand the harsh Alaskan winters.\n\nWith snow adding an additional layer of warmth (much in the way an igloo works), this home has superior energy efficiency. The interior features custom built-ins that complement home's unusual shape. Curved windows in the master bedroom follow the curve of the house, and an attic room with a domed ceiling is perfectly Hobbit-sized.\n\nLet's face it: Alaska living isn't for everyone.

Here's what you need to know", "text": "You'd be hard-pressed these days to find any homeowners who haven't considered renting out their home on Airbnb or a similar site\u2014it's certainly tempting to make extra cash on a room that's just sitting empty. And if you're out of town this summer anyway, why not have someone basically pay you to housesit?\n\nBut listing your home on Airbnb isn't quite as easy as snapping some photos and posting them online. Many cities across the globe have regulated the short-term lodging service in order to keep guests and homeowners safe and honest. Navigating these rules might seem daunting, but we've broken down the basics that first-timers need to know right here\u2014a beginner's guide to hosting on Airbnb.\n\n1. Follow hosting etiquette\n\nAirbnb has a list of hosting standards that cover everything from communication to cleanliness, explains Shannon Hyde, the global operations manager at GuestReady, an Airbnb management company with locations across the globe.\n\nThink you can just offer up a bed and be done with it? Nope. You need to make sure you've provided essential items such as toilet paper, soap and linens for each booked guest.\n\nAnd even though your plans might change, you'll want to avoid canceling on your guests at any time.\n\nWhile these aren\u2019t \"rules\" in the sense that they\u2019re enforceable or come with penalties for violating them, they will have a major impact on the success of your hosting endeavor.\n\n2. Safety is your responsibility\n\nIf you're a U.S.-based host, you'll also want to take a close look at Airbnb's guide to responsible hosting in the United States. You'll need to do your due diligence to prepare guests for emergency situations (e.g., providing a first-aid kit and a list of emergency numbers that includes the nearest hospital), and stay up to code when it comes to smoke and carbon monoxide detectors.\n\n3. Permits might be required\n\nThis hosting thing doesn't come without its costs to you. That's only fair, right? As Airbnb notes, most cities require hosts to apply (and usually pay a fee) for permits or registrations in order to legally rent out their home\u2014even if it's just for a few days. Don't even think about skirting this.\n\n\u201cEnsure you look up any permitting, zoning, safety, and health regulations that may apply,\u201d the service's site notes, directing users to explore the specific government agencies that regulate the use of property in their particular town or city.\n\nFor example, in Minneapolis, it\u2019s the Housing and Fire Inspections department; in San Francisco, it\u2019s the Office of Short-Term Rentals.\n\n4. There's a limit to how long you can host\n\nHave a guesthouse or second property that you want to make a permanent Airbnb offering? Before you fancy yourself Scrooge McDuck swimming in a pond of money, know this: There are usually rules on how long you can rent out your house.\n\nWhile each city is different, Stephen Fishman, a lawyer who specializes in tax and business law, says you should verify the following information:\n\nHow many days a year homeowners are allowed to rent to short-term guests.\n\nHow many consecutive days homeowners can rent to short-term guests.\n\nWhy does it matter? In some cities and states, guests who stay in a home for a certain number of consecutive days are able to be considered tenants. That means that you'd have to go through a complicated eviction process in the event they don't want to leave\u2014in other words, you could have a squatter nightmare on your hands.\n\nIf you don't comply with your city's regulations, you could also face hefty fines. Just last year, a woman in Trump Tower was fined $1,000 for violating New York's recent ban on short-term rentals.\n\nAvoid the hassle by finding the cutoff date in your jurisdiction\u2014and don't let anyone stay longer than that. No exceptions.\n\n5. HOA and co-op rules might apply\n\nLike cities, homeowners associations and co-ops take a different approach to regulating short-term rentals. Some places might have no rules at all, while others can ban subleasing altogether.\n\nEven if your community doesn't have specific rules regarding short-term rentals, there are often clauses regarding following local regulations and zoning laws. That means hosts can be on the hook\u2014not only with the city but also with their HOA\u2014if they don't follow the law.\n\n6. Rental income has to be reported...\n\nAny profits you earn from renting out your home are subject to income tax. Before tax time rolls around, make sure you do your homework about how to report rental income.\n\nOne big thing to know: If you're a U.S. citizen, you're subject to income tax\u2014even if your property is located outside the U.S. If you're from outside the U.S. but have a U.S.-based property?

It's not what you think", "text": "The Journal of Social Psychological and Personality Science (SPPS) released a study last month demonstrating that religious people live longer. The study observed that \u201cself-reported religious service attendance has been linked with longevity,\u201d and confirmed this by examining obituaries from 43 U.S. cities. Researchers found that religiously affiliated people lived between 5.64 and 9.45 years longer than those who were not religiously affiliated.\n\nThe findings from SPPS are consistent with many other studies. A JAMA Internal Medicine study found that \u201cwomen who went to any kind of religious service more than once a week had a 33 percent lower chance \u201cthan their secular peers of dying\u201d during the 16 years following the research. Another JAMA study reported that women who attended religious services at least once a week were \u201cassociated with an approximately 5-fold lower rate of suicide\u201d than those who never attend a service. A PLOS One study reported that people who attend religious services regularly experience less stress and were \u201c55 percent less likely to die\u201d over the next 18 years than those who did not attend.\n\nWhy do religiously active people outlive their non-religious peers? A recent article at The American Council on Science and Health attempted to provide an answer as they examined the SPPS findings:\n\n\u201c\u2026\u2018the opportunities and incentives to volunteer and participate in other social groups provided by religious communities\u2019 were in part responsible for the lengthening life-span. Those who might recoil at religious belief extending life might consider engaging in social activity and friendship as the real underlying correlation.\u201d\n\nSo, according to the American Council on Science and Health, the real benefit to religious people is simply their increased level of social engagement and friendship. A journalist at Time.com recently agreed: \u201cYou don\u2019t have to become a nun to get these health benefits\u2026 The simple act of congregating with a like-minded community might deserve much of the credit.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe simple act of congregating with a like-minded community\u201d will never match the healing power and extended commitment offered by a family \u2013 even if that family is simply your religious community.\n\nReally? If that\u2019s the case, then why do religiously affiliated people consistently live longer than their non-religious peers?\n\nThe truth is that religious communities are substantively different than non-religious communities.\n\nI noticed this for the first time when serving on a missions trip as a youth pastor with a group of Christians at the University of California at Berkeley. One night we met a group of non-believers off campus for an open dialogue about matters of faith, science and philosophy. The large room was filled with young people - half were Christians, half were self-described atheists. Both groups were part of longstanding communities in which members had come to know each other as friends.\n\nOur time together was wonderful. We shared a meal and engaged in a warm, interactive conversation, even though we were in complete disagreement about several important issues. By the end of the evening, the non-believers got a chance to experience our group and we got a chance to experience theirs. We also had the opportunity to answer each other\u2019s questions.\n\nI was personally impressed with the obvious friendships between the non-believers and their hospitality toward our group. But there was a clear difference between the two communities. The non-religious group was united by their commitment to a common interest. Our group was united by a commitment to a common Father. This difference is critical.\n\nA common interest can bind us as friends, but a common Father binds us as family. Most of us, if raised in loving families, understand why this difference matters. Your family is more likely to love you, even when you\u2019re occasionally unlovable. Your family is also more likely to sacrifice for you if times get tough. They remember and actively participate in your common family rituals and routines. They recognize your family history and understand the lens through which you view yourself and the world around you.\n\nThat\u2019s why \u201cthe simple act of congregating with a like-minded community\u201d will never match the healing power and extended commitment offered by a family \u2013 even if that family is simply your religious community.\n\nThat\u2019s why religious people will continue to live longer.", "authors": ["J.

I don\u2019t play soccer, and the tournament is being hosted by the nation that has violated the sovereignty of Ukraine, my homeland. And yet I\u2019m delighted that the eyes of the world are turned there.\n\nWhy? Because I believe the World Cup provides an unprecedented opportunity for the church in Russia, at a time when the doors for religious freedom seem to be in danger of closing.\n\nAnd together with my colleagues at Mission Eurasia, a U.S.-based nonprofit that trains and equips young Christian leaders for ministry across the former Communist region, I\u2019m hoping the event prompts a worldwide outpouring of prayer for a nation so in need of the gospel.\n\nDrawing a massive global television audience, the competition comes at an interesting time for Russia. It generates widespread international goodwill for the country, even as Russia pursues an increasingly isolationist position.\n\nWhile meddling beyond its borders, Russia is also actively restricting freedoms at home for non-Orthodox Christians and other religious minorities. Legislation passed in 2016 under the guise of counter-terrorism measures has restricted Christians\u2019 rights to share their faith outside the walls of registered churches. According to watchdogs, there have been more than 600 cases of religious freedom violations in the past two years.\n\nI remember vividly during the Soviet regime how believers used all kinds of events to spread the gospel\u2014even turning wedding ceremonies and funeral processions into opportunities for evangelism.\n\nThis troubling move recently prompted Bishop Sergey Ryakhovskiy, the spokesperson for all Russian Protestants, to call churches to join a national day of fasting and prayer on June 17. Thousands of churches formed a continuous prayer chain across Russia\u2019s 11 time zones, asking God for the freedom to share the gospel during the World Cup.\n\n\u201cToday we are witnessing evangelical churches in different regions of the country being put under pressure,\u201d Ryakhovskiy said, announcing the day of prayer. \u201cWe believe that it is not only our legal right, but also that the blessing of our land and prosperity of the people directly depend on how much the country and the people are open to preaching the gospel.\u201d\n\nThe World Cup has been providing a rare window of opportunity for churches to do that by using public events. With evangelistic activity restricted to officially recognized churches by the new laws, several hundred across the country have been hosting free, live big-screen broadcasts of the competition.\n\nAt these \u201cfan zones,\u201d visitors have been watching the televised action, enjoying free refreshments and snacks, getting the chance to hear the gospel and receiving free evangelistic literature and Scripture.\n\nThis creative initiative, developed and sponsored by Mission Eurasia, harkens back to a previous time when religious freedom in Russia was under threat.

I was finishing up grad school when my wife first talked to me about starting a family. First I had to decide if I was going to continue on to an advanced degree or get a job.\n\nThe decision about continuing in school was a big one because it would mean moving to England to attend Oxford. Ultimately I decided not to do it (though several years later I did go to Duke) so we decided to go ahead and have a kid.\n\nI would not recommend my method of choosing to start a family. You should give it a lot more thought than I did. I just figured it was the next natural step after marriage so we took the dive into parenthood.\n\nI\u2019ve learned a lot since then about parenting. It is not for the faint of heart. It is a time consuming job. And it is incredibly rewarding. Raising my sons has been one of the great joys of my life. I may have never dreamed about being a dad but I sure have loved being one.\n\nMy boys are now grown men. One serves his country as an Army officer, the other helps our country by working in the alternative energy field. One is single, the other is married. And next month he is going to become a dad himself.\n\nThey are not perfect and have made their share of mistakes. But they have had a lot of success in their few years on earth - academically, athletically, professionally and relationally.\n\nHere is what I learned about developing them to be successful.\n\nDevelop Their Self Image\n\nYour kids need to know how much you matter to them. They must believe you love them unconditionally. To the extent that any person can do that since only God can fully do it. Speak words of affirmation so they know how you see them.\n\nA defined set of values is crucial to a successful life. Having a relationship with God through Jesus Christ and following His teachings should be their highest priority.\n\nI\u2019ve always told my boys I am their number one supporter. No one believes in them more than me. And I had to prove it at various times in my parenting. Sometimes it cost me time and sometimes it cost quite a bit of money.\n\nHelp them to have a positive outlook on life and their future. Keep them focused on their God-given potential. Expect great things from them, keep your expectations high. Get them to believe what you believe about them.\n\nThey will deal with rejection, especially in the teenage years. They will be discouraged and even depressed at times. Motivate them by your words and your actions. Be an encourager every time they need it.\n\nDevelop Their Individual Achievement\n\nIt is crucial that every child know they can do one thing well. It really doesn\u2019t matter what it is. They just need to have the knowledge that there is something they do well. And that others know it too.\n\nAchieving a degree of mastery in something works wonders for children. When they know they are good at something it will foster a potential mindset. This opens the door for all kinds of future opportunities.\n\nIt might be academics; it might be in athletics or something else. Music, art, and robotics \u2013 the list is greater today than it has ever been. You can assist them in finding what they enjoy.\n\nWhen they find it, your role is to challenge them to be the best. Inspire them to achieve success and experience the joy of accomplishment. Invite them to aspire to greater things. When they do, their self-confidence will be your gift to them.\n\nDevelop Their People Skills\n\nIQ is God given. EI is self-developed. Their emotional intelligence may have more to do with their long-term success than their innate intelligence. There are smart people and those with people skills. Both are required today for lifelong success.\n\nDaniel Goleman coined the term emotional intelligence to describe the ability to manage yourself and your relationships effectively. Many experts believe EI is as important as IQ in determining personal and professional success. EI comprises four fundamental capabilities: self-awareness, self-management, social awareness and social skill. Each capability contains a set of competencies.\n\nCompetencies like empathy: the skill at sensing other people\u2019s emotions. Self-control: the ability to keep disruptive emotions and impulses under control. Building bonds: proficiency at cultivating and maintaining a host of relationships.\n\nCommunication: skill at listening and at sending clear, well-understood messages. Teamwork and collaboration: competence at promoting cooperation and team building. Self-awareness: the ability to read and understand your emotions as well as recognize their impact on your relationships.\n\nTeaching your kids these skills will foster a lifetime of healthy relationships. Which is a key to them having a happy life.\n\nDevelop Their Spiritual Foundation\n\nI think this is the most important to develop in your children. We have a mind, body and soul. All need to be cared for but the most important is your soul, because it is eternal. Make sure their soul is saved through faith in Jesus.\n\nDo not let them decide whether they go to church. Take them and expose them to the Bible\u2019s teachings, community and ways to serve. Guide them in their faith journey.\n\nA defined set of values is crucial to a successful life. Having a relationship with God through Jesus Christ and following His teachings should be their highest priority.\n\nHelp them to consider the big questions of life. Who am I? Why am I here? What is the meaning and purpose of life? Take advantage of these innumerable teachable moments in your parenting.\n\nAssist them in discovering God\u2019s plan for their lives. God has set them up for success, giving them talents, abilities, gifts and opportunities to do something meaningful with their lives.\n\nEvery parent makes mistakes along the way.

I could see myself on the phone with Mom again \u2014 the pink curtains, the chest of drawers, the heavy green phone. It bothered me.\n\nI didn\u2019t want to live like that anymore. I couldn\u2019t stay in that room for the rest of my life \u2014 I decided to welcome Jesus into it.\n\nI prayed and God gave me a mental picture of the room. As I answered the phone call and got the awful news, I envisioned Jesus there with me, watching as my mom accidentally told me Erin was dead.\n\nWhen I hung up the phone, I looked at Jesus and told Him the news. And then I remembered how Jesus reacted when His dear friend died. The Scripture\u2019s description is simple: \u201cJesus wept\u201d (John 11:35).\n\nI believe Jesus wept with me when I learned that Erin was gone. I believe He wept with you when you went through that unforgettable, painful moment. I believe He\u2019s with you and me now as we walk through new and challenging spaces. And I believe that one day, all of these spaces inside of us will pass away and we\u2019ll get a new home.\n\nJesus said, \u201cThere are many rooms in My Father\u2019s house. If it were not so, I would have told you. I am going away to make a place for you. After I go and make a place for you, I will come back and take you with Me. Then you may be where I am.\u201d (John 14:2-3).\n\nUntil that day, we can invite Jesus into those hard spaces we can\u2019t forget. He will meet us there and one day lead us home.", "authors": ["Joshua Rogers"], "url": "http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2018/07/07/unexpected-discovery-years-after-devastating-phone-call.html"}, {"title": "Secrets (good and bad) no one is telling about motherhood", "text": "Way, way back in 2002 I wrote a book about the domino effect that occurs when women try to raise children, babies and toddlers in particular, and pursue full-time career simultaneously. The subtitle of the book (which has since been re-released as \u201cThe Two-Income Trap: Why Parents Are Choosing to Stay Home\u201d ) was \u201cWhy Children and Most Careers Just Don\u2019t Mix,\u201d and its overall message was that the needs and demands of children are so great that to try and meet those needs and demands after being spent from a day at the office is fruitless. What\u2019s more, it yanks the joy of motherhood right out of you.\n\nI wrote that book to help women who\u2019ve been taught to map out their futures without giving any thought at all to how their lives will change down the road when they become mothers. Not only are women surprised to find out how taxing motherhood is, they don\u2019t anticipate how much they\u2019d want to be with their babies.\n\nNeedless to say, I was lambasted in the media for daring to write a book that outlined the costs of working motherhood. But fifteen years later, the results are in.\n\nA new report by the National Bureau of Economic Research shows that women today \u201cfrequently underestimate the time, money and effort it takes to raise children and have a career at the same time, leading many to invest in their skills and then reluctantly leave the workforce when the true costs of being a working mother become apparent,\u201d writes Lauren Weber at The Wall Street Journal.\n\nDespite this reality, the message isn\u2019t getting across to younger women. According to the NBER report, female high school seniors \u201care increasingly and substantially overestimating the likelihood they will be in the labor market in their thirties.\u201d\n\nSo here\u2019s a logical follow-up question: Why don\u2019t young women understand what children, babies in particular, need? And why do they assume they\u2019ll be just as career-driven in their thirties as they were in their twenties?\n\nI\u2019ll answer those questions with two more questions: Why wouldn\u2019t modern women be in the dark about motherhood? And why wouldn\u2019t they assume they\u2019d never leave the workforce?\n\nSince the day they were born, college-bound women have been groomed for a life at the office rather than for a life at home. No one told them their priorities will shift down the line. No one told them how overwhelming motherhood is without a career, let alone with one. Most importantly, no one told them how joyful motherhood can be.\n\nIn previous generations, women embraced this transformation and viewed marriage and family not just as the center of their lives but as the purpose of life. Modern women, by contrast, view a career as their life\u2019s purpose and assume they can squeeze marriage and family in around this otherwise more pressing endeavor \u2013 if they squeeze it in at all.\n\nThe problem with this plan is that by the time the average woman hits 30, the likelihood of her deciding that marriage and motherhood, not career, is the most important thing in her life is astronomically high. Too many women needlessly wind up in a quandary when they become mothers. Many are shocked to discover that what they thought was important before they had children feels utterly irrelevant afterward.\n\nIf we know this to be true, why don\u2019t we help young women better prepare for their futures? Why should young women map out their lives as though husbands and babies aren\u2019t going to come along and happily put a wrench in those plans? Why don\u2019t we change the question and ask not what motherhood\u2019s effect on employment will be but what effect employment will have on a woman when she becomes a mother?\n\nOf course the culture will never ask this question, so it\u2019s up to parents to circumvent the narrative their daughters will invariably receive. I have a daughter who\u2019s headed off to college in the fall, and like most girls she plans to get married and have children someday. Great, I told her. Here are three important things you need to know:\n\n1. Whom you choose to marry will have more effect on your happiness and well-being than any other choice you make in life. So make sure you focus at least as much on getting that decision right as you do on nailing down a career.\n\n2. Don\u2019t assume you\u2019ll always be in the workforce. Trying to juggle full-time work while raising babies isn\u2019t just stressful, it\u2019s unfair to your yet-to-be-born children. Babies have needs that must be met, and a mother is in the best position to meet those needs. The attempt to \u2018have it all\u2019 is futile. Something always suffers, and it\u2019s usually the kids \u2013 as Indra K. Nooyi, CEO of PepsiCo, courageously admitted in 2014. Knowing this in advance can help you make smart decisions in life and in love.\n\n3. Don\u2019t forget that your body has an agenda of its own. You have a window with which to conceive children the natural way. If you put motherhood off too long, you invite unnecessary hardship \u2013 physically, financially and psychologically \u2013 into your life. For most women, this is completely avoidable.\n\nThat women today are unprepared for motherhood isn\u2019t the least bit surprising. But the onus is on their parents and the culture, who insisted that women focus on their educations and careers to the exclusion of everything else. \u201cIf I could go back ten years,\u201d Rachel Lehmann-Haupt writes in \u201cThe Aniston Syndrome,\u201d \u201cI would tell my younger self that she should deeply consider her future family\u2026I wonder whether in fact my generation collectively screwed up.\u201d\n\nIndeed.", "authors": ["Suzanne Venker"], "url": "http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2018/07/07/secrets-good-and-bad-no-one-is-telling-about-motherhood.html"}, {"title": "Ann Voskamp: Tell yourself this when you feel forgotten and invisible and unimportant", "text": "Editor's note: The following column is adapted from author Ann Voskamp's book, \"The Broken Way.\"\n\nDear Self and me and you and us,\n\nReally, it\u2019s all going to be okay.\n\nYou\u2019re going to be okay.\n\n\n\nPromise.\n\nRemember when you were 16 with that ridiculous hair?\n\nAnd how you\u2019d thought that by the time you got to here, to now, it was going to be good?

The company was keen to maintain control of its own plant and protect its technology.\n\nBut it registered a new electric car firm in Shanghai in May after China announced that it planned to scrap rules on capping foreign ownership of new-energy vehicle (NEV) ventures by 2022.\n\nThe agreements signed on Tuesday also include a memorandum of understanding between Tesla and the Shanghai municipal government, under which Shanghai agreed to support Tesla to set up a research and development innovation center.\n\n(Reporting by Brenda Goh; Additional Reporting by Shanghai and Beijing Newsrooms and Sweta Singh in Bengaluru Newsroom Editing by Alexandra Hudson)", "authors": [], "url": "http://www.foxbusiness.com/features/tesla-to-open-plant-in-shanghai-with-annual-capacity-of-500000-cars-report"}, {"title": "Will Elon Musk\u2019s \u2018kid submarine\u2019 be used in Thai rescue?", "text": "article\n\nBillionaire Elon Musk\u2019s \u2018mini\u2019 submarine developed by his SpaceX team is set to arrive in Thailand around 11 p.m. local time, 12:00 p.m. ET on Monday, according to his tweet.\n\nContinue Reading Below\n\nMusk and his team hope the skinny sub will aid in the rescue of the remaining five members of the youth soccer team who are trapped in a cave, but if the rescuers succeed on their own, Musk sees the sub as a future tool in high-risk rescues.\n\n\u201cMini-sub arriving in about 17 hours,\u201d he tweeted on Sunday. \"Hopefully useful.

They never step foot outside the church.\n\nChavez, 30, is afraid that U.S. immigration officials would round them up and send them back to Honduras, where she said she fears for their safety because of an abusive boyfriend. Her fears led her to seek asylum in the United States four years ago.\n\nDespite immigration judges repeatedly denying her request, Chavez told reporters Monday night that she's determined to remain in the church and fight to stay in the Utah, where her parents and siblings live. In a long-shot effort, her lawyers are seeking relief from a federal appeals court.\n\n\"I shall keep fighting. I can help to be the voice of the other mothers that are seeking asylum from domestic abuse,\" Chavez said, surrounded by supporters holding signs. \"We come to this country to feel safe and protected.\"\n\nShe said seeing other immigrant parents separated from their children at the border makes her even more reticent to return home and face a possible split from her daughters if she tried to seek U.S. asylum again.\n\n\"I can't imagine feeling the pain of being separated from one of my daughters,\" Chavez said in Spanish during an interview with The Associated Press last month. \"Sleeping in a detention center is not easy at all. I lived it. And I lived it with my daughter, but not separated.\"\n\nU.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement considers Chavez an immigration fugitive, spokesman Carl Rusnok said in an email Monday.\n\nShe entered the United States illegally in June 2014 and was ordered deported by a federal immigration judge in December 2016, Rusnok said. Chavez exhausted her appeals on Jan. 30, he said.\n\nThat night, Chavez had a plane ticket home to San Pedro Sula, Honduras. But instead she accepted an offer of sanctuary from the First Unitarian Church.\n\nShe and her daughters sleep in a converted Sunday school room and spend most of their time in another room with a TV, easel and other games. Yaretzi, the 6-year-old, receives piano classes in the chapel, and they dance and run in an open room with wood floors.\n\nBaby Issabella learned to walk in the church and celebrated her first birthday early there this month. Yaretzi gets tutored instead of attending school.\n\n\"I feel sad because I can't give my daughter a normal life,\" Chavez said.\n\nThe family is among 44 people taking sanctuary in the U.S., according to information from Church World Service.\n\nBut they are the first known immigrants to take sanctuary in Utah, according to local immigration advocates and the state chapter of the American Civil Liberties Union. The practice has been common in states such as Arizona and California but unheard of in Utah, where Mormons account for about two-thirds of the population.\n\nThe Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints takes a compassionate stance on immigration and recently said it was \"deeply troubled\" by the family separations at the border but doesn't offer sanctuary to immigrants.\n\nThe Rev. Tom Goldsmith of the First Unitarian Church in Salt Lake City said his congregation of about 300 families voted a decade ago to welcome a sanctuary case.\n\nWhen a local immigrant support group presented Chavez's case, the congregation decided to help, he said. President Donald Trump's administration strengthened their commitment, he said.\n\n\"It's too easy to just conduct business as usual as a group of predominantly white, privileged parishioners,\" Goldsmith said. \"There is a deep calling to widen the love and commitment to social justice. To not only show up at demonstrations or protests or marches but to actually in a very tangible form prove that we really mean what we say.\"\n\nSome 200 church members and other volunteers help ensure the Chavez family is fed, educated, supported and protected. Church members tutor Yaretzi. They shop for groceries so the family has food they like.\n\nAnd they take turns guarding the church's one unlocked door around the clock, Goldsmith said. Though immigration authorities generally don't enter churches, the church isn't taking any chances, he said.\n\nICE agents must have prior approval from a supervisor to take action in churches because they are considered \"sensitive locations,\" which also include schools and hospitals, Rusnok said.\n\nChavez said she wants the chance to stay in the country that has been home to her parents and siblings for decades and where she and her children enjoy a peaceful life.\n\nShe and her supporters know she faces a steep hurdle after U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions, who oversees immigration courts, declared that domestic and gang violence are generally not sufficient grounds for asylum. Still, she says she has no choice.\n\n\"I don't have family in Honduras. I don't have a place to take my girls,\" Chavez said. \"I came because I'm running away from domestic violence. We were receiving death threats. ... I'm scared to return to Honduras. Not just for me, but for my girls.\"\n\n___\n\nSee AP's complete coverage of the immigration debate: https://apnews.com/tag/Immigration", "authors": [], "url": "http://www.foxnews.com/us/2018/07/10/honduran-woman-vows-to-fight-for-asylum-from-utah-church.html"}, {"title": "Trump's UK trip prompts US embassy in London warning to American tourists: 'Keep a low profile'", "text": "The U.S. embassy in London has warned Americans to \u201ckeep a low profile\u201d during President Trump's visit to England later this week.\n\n\u201cNumerous demonstrations are planned\u201d from July 12 to July 14, with a majority of protests occurring in central London on Friday, the embassy said in an alert Tuesday.

My parents taught me its significance.\n\nMy earliest lesson about why we celebrate the Fourth of July came when I first noticed my father flinching during the beautiful light shows I loved. Mom explained that the fireworks\u2019 bursts triggered terrible memories of the ferocious three-hour battle in Vietnam that cost the lives of two of his men and in which he gave his left arm and eye.\n\nOver the years, Daddy taught me more about his experiences \u2013 how he had joined the Marines after seeing someone burn our flag and how he had survived war because Pfc. Ralph Johnson, a selfless Marine on his recon team, threw himself on a grenade to protect his friends. And I began to fall in love with our nation, its brave veterans, and its birthday celebration because of the passion I heard in my father\u2019s voice.\n\nMy affection for the Fourth grew as my parents taught me more about our nation\u2019s history. We traveled to Colonial Williamsburg, where costumed re-enactors brought history to life, providing the background I needed to understand why the Declaration of Independence was such an essential and pivotal part of our nation\u2019s history.

With this visit, our national anthem took on a new life for me.\n\nAnd we studied relevant family stories together, learning that our ancestor \u2013 Jeremiah \u201cPappy\u201d Vereen \u2013 fought in the Revolutionary War and hosted George Washington on the first president\u2019s tour of the southern states.

He helped the club win four Champions League titles \u2014 beating Juventus in the final in 2017 \u2014 and also won the league and cup twice each.\n\n\"In addition to the titles he won, Cristiano Ronaldo has been an example of dedication, work, responsibility, talent and determination,\" Madrid said. \"For Real Madrid, Cristiano Ronaldo will always be one of its greatest symbols and a unique reference for the next generations. Real Madrid will always be his home.\"\n\nRonaldo signed a five-year deal with Madrid in 2016, saying he wanted to end his career at the club. But he has also publicly expressed his discontentment about being jeered at times by some Madrid fans at the Santiago Bernabeu Stadium.\n\nRonaldo was also moved by the Juventus fans for giving him a standing ovation after he scored a spectacular goal against the Italian club at the Allianz Stadium in the Champions League quarterfinals last season.\n\nRonaldo made his debut for Sporting Lisbon when he was 17. His crossover dribble was already famous when Alex Ferguson brought him to Manchester United ahead of the 2003-04 season and gave him the No. 7 shirt of the recently departed David Beckham.\n\nHe spent six seasons in England, winning three Premier League titles, one Champions League title and one FA Cup.\n\nRonaldo led Portugal to its first major title at the European Championship two years ago in France. He helped the Portuguese team reach the semifinals in his first World Cup in 2006.\n\nPortugal was eliminated by Uruguay in the round of 16 of this year's tournament in Russia. Ronaldo scored four goals to take his tally to 85 for his country and break Ferenc Puskas' record as Europe's all-time leading international scorer.\n\n", "authors": [], "url": "http://www.foxnews.com/sports/2018/07/10/cristiano-ronaldo-leaving-real-madrid-to-join-juventus.html"}, {"title": "New Orleans teen shown at wake in Kyrie Irving jersey, playing 'NBA 2K' video game", "text": "The family of a New Orleans teen who was killed in a shooting two weeks ago celebrated his life Sunday by choosing to have his body prepared in a unique way.\n\nRenard Matthews, 18, was shown at the Charbonnet Labat Glapion Funeral Home in Treme dressed in a Kyrie Irving jersey and sunglasses with a Playstation controller in his hand while an \u2018NBA 2K\u2019 game was being played on the screen between his beloved Boston Celtics and Golden State Warriors, WGNO-TV reported.\n\nMatthews was also dressed in Irving socks and had a bag of Doritos next to him.\n\nMatthews would usually stay at home and only venture outside to walk the dog, his mother, Temeka Matthews, told WGNO-TV.

The panel found that the military had unrestricted control over KBR, rendering company decisions on waste management and water services \"de facto military decisions\" not appropriate for judicial review.\n\nIt was a crushing blow to those who filed the original class-action lawsuits, who maintain they were made ill by the use of open-air burn pits. On Tuesday, attorneys representing them filed a motion for the court of appeals to conduct an \u201cen banc\u201d review -- in which a case is heard before all judges of a court as opposed to the panel that made last month\u2019s decision.\n\n\u201cThe panel acknowledged the district court\u2019s finding that the evidence established that the military determined that hazardous materials were \u2018to be segregated and disposed of by a method other than surface burning\u2019 and were \u2018not authorized to be placed in burn pits,\u2019\u201d reads a copy of the motion obtained by Fox News. \u201cYet the panel held that the district court did not clearly err when it wholly discounted both the evidence (sworn declarations) and the allegations in the complaint.\"\n\nMore than 60 lawsuits allege that KBR's practice of dumping tires, batteries, medical waste and other materials into open burn pits created harmful smoke that caused neurological problems, cancers and other health issues in more than 800 service members.\n\nAttorneys for the plaintiffs maintain in this recent motion that the evidence against KBR, about improper waste disposal methods at military bases during the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, is hard to ignore.\n\n\u201cThe panel\u2019s decision cannot be squared with the evidentiary record, which establishes that KBR burned batteries and other hazardous materials in burn pits on thousands of instances,\u201d reads another passage in the motion. \u201cGiven that 181 service members filed declarations both in 2011 and 2016, and another 525 service members filed declarations in 2016, the evidentiary record establishing KBR\u2019s systemic burning of hazardous material is substantial and robust.\u201d\n\nThe motion further states that a new review should be considered because the original panel\u2019s decision was problematic.\n\n\u201cThe panel\u2019s desultory review of the record is all the more problematic because KBR did not rebut this evidence with contradictory submissions. Instead, KBR\u2019s contract manager (David Palmer) admitted that hazardous materials should not have been burned, and testified that KBR was permitted to burn general waste but not hazardous materials.\u201d\n\nDuring arguments before the 4th Circuit last month, Susan Burke, a lawyer for the service members, argued that KBR repeatedly violated the terms of its contract with the military to handle waste disposal. She said KBR also disobeyed a military directive against burning hazardous materials.\n\nKBR's attorney, Warren Harris, told the court that the decision to use burn pits was made by the military, which also made decisions on where the pits would be located, what hours they would operate and what would be burned in them.\n\nIn a recent statement to Fox News, KBR officials say the appeals court decision made last month was crucial in ending a long battle in court.\n\n\u201cKBR is pleased that the Court of Appeals has confirmed that the trial court made the correct decision and that this legacy case is one step closer to final resolution,\u201d reads a statement from officials at the contracting firm. \u201cAs KBR has consistently stated, KBR operated burn pits at a very limited number of bases in Iraq and Afghanistan and KBR personnel operated safely and effectively at the direction and under the control of the U.S. military.\u201d\n\nThe Associated Press contributed reporting to this story.", "authors": ["Perry Chiaramonte"], "url": "http://www.foxnews.com/us/2018/07/05/veterans-press-on-with-new-appeal-in-burn-pit-case.html"}, {"title": "Marine vet gets smart home (and independence) from Gary Sinise Foundation", "text": "On April 11, 2012, two weeks into his sixth combat deployment, Major Eric Burkett's V-22 Osprey tilt rotor aircraft crashed in North Africa.

The Stars and Stripes neatly rolled up and attached to the gear of deployed military personnel. The red, white and blue standing in contrast with the muted colors of uniforms designed to conceal.\n\nWhy do they carry the flag? Whether it's being used to identify themselves to coalition fighter jets, mark territory claimed on the battlefield, or serve as a vivid and cherished memento, the American flag serves many a purpose among our forces down range.\n\n\u201cWe always carried a flag on the first operation in a new environment,\u201d retired Lt. Col. James Reese said.\n\nIt certainly adds context to those famous words written by Francis Scott Key: \" Oh, say can you see, by the dawn's early light.\"\n\nCurrently, there are more than 1.3 million active-duty personnel in the Army, Navy, Marine Corps, Air Force and Coast Guard, according to the Department of Defense. The servicemen and women are spread among at least a dozen countries, including the United States itself.\n\n\"We always carried a flag on the first operation in a new environment.\" - Lieutenant Colonel James Reese, US Army (RET)\n\nSpecial Operations Forces (SOF), the elite units most often seen with the flag, are not nearly as numerous. According to U.S. Special Operations Command, there are just over 57,000 active-duty SOF fighters.\n\nOf that number, only about 8,300 are deployed across 90 countries. In 2017, the Defense Department moved more than 15 percent of the deployed SOF fighters to assist African militaries, up from just 1 percent the year prior. There are roughly 1,200 SOF soldiers deployed to about a dozen African countries.\n\nIn 2007, after 25 years of service, Reese retired as a commander in the elite Army unit known as Delta Force. He told Fox News that soldiers often carry flags in case communications break down and they need to identify themselves to friendly forces.\n\nThis becomes especially important when special operations units are fighting with a coalition of different nations\u2019 fighter jets providing support from on high. He called the flag a last ditch \u201cfar-recognition signal\u201d on the battlefield.\n\nIt\u2019s especially important for soldiers in places like Syria, where myriad nations provide air support but only a select few, including American fighters, are on the ground.\n\n\u201cFlags are carried so they can be put up when we occupy a new compound or fire base,\u201d said another active-duty Army first sergeant, who requested anonymity because of his continuing ongoing service.\n\nReese said soldiers have been given greater autonomy over their garb in recent years, as long as they satisfy the standard packing lists mandated by commanders. Usually, soldiers must carry more than 200 rounds of ammo, medical kits, MRE rations, a weapon cleaning kit and a map, to name a few items.\n\nWhen he was first in the Army Rangers in the 1980s, Reese said, all uniforms were disciplined and standardized, a practice that looked sharp but wasn\u2019t the most practical for every soldier.\n\nThis mindset changed after the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001. Now, he said, military branches in the U.S. and abroad mimic the way Special Operation Forces prepare and fight.\n\n\u201cWhat soldiers look like now is what we looked like 12, 15 years ago,\u201d he said. \u201cThe military has quickly caught on to different ways we wear our armor. \u2026 [We\u2019re] set up to be efficient.\u201d\n\nEfficiency of movement and mind is what Reese said kept him alive during his decades of service.

Brexit is quite a complicated process there's a lot of trade deals that need to be worked out. We need to negotiate our future relationship with the EU and what the cabinet agreed to on Friday are what a lot of people who agree with Brexit are very very unhappy with. It leaves the UK in very close regulatory with the EU. (2:45)\n\nOn who has resigned and why it is significant: Yesterday West Minister was absolutely shocked by the huge resignation of the Brexit secretary, the man who is supposed to be negotiating our exit from the EU, David Davis he took one of his junior ministers with him, which was seen as a blow to the leadership of Theresa May whose been trying to bring together the people who voted to leave and the people who voted to remain. And then just today we had our foreign secretary Boris Johnson resign. (3:52)\n\nOn how this impacts the United States: One of the reasons for one of these resignations in the first place is that this new Brexit policy of Theresa May could jeopardize a future trade deal between the UK and the US by locking us in with the EU in terms of the regulations that we have on goods and agricultural products. It would make a trade deal with the US much much harder. (5:27)\n\nOn if there may be more resignations: There's been a lot of chatter today about more cabinet ministers that may be resigning. Our International Trade Secretary Liam Fox is said to be very very close to resigning and there are some other Brexit supporting ministers that could.

The president tweeted,\n\n\"I have long heard that the most important decision a U.S. President can make is the selection of a Supreme Court Justice - Will be announced tonight at 9:00 P.M.\"\n\nRepublicans and Democrats are gearing up for a blistering confirmation process, as Republicans hold a slim majority in the Senate and liberals have expressed fear that Trump's pick could join the conservatives on the court to someday overturn the Roe v. Wade decision.\n\nFox News Politics Editor Chris Stirewalt sat down with Fox News Radio's Guy Benson and Marie Harf to give his insight into President Trump's nomination.\n\nOn who he predicts Trump will nominate: So the Times is reporting, and no one is disputing, that the president was down to two that it was Kavanaugh and Hardiman. Now Hardiman is the most \"Gorsuch-ian,\" I would say, selection here. He was the runner up to Gorsuch. Kavanough is the interesting one. He's a \"Bushie.\" He was staff secretary for George W. Bush. Kavanaugh's the easiest to get to 50, but he's probably also the easiest for Democrats to vote against because they can oppose him for those very things. (1:12)\n\nOn the secrecy of who the nominee is: Well, to a substantial degree they've outsourced it, which makes it easier between the Federalist Society and Mitch McConnell. So, they've outsourced this much as they did with Gorsuch but now there's a more cohered way of doing it and that means it doesn't go through the normal bramble in the West Wing. (3:34)\n\nOn Federalist Society: I don't find the Federalist Society's involvement here any more pernicious than I find the American Barr Association's involvement in picks for Democrats. It's a vetting group. It's not like they're not transparent about what they're doing and what they want. (11:02)\n\nOn if the Supreme Court nomination affects Senate race predictions: It absolutely will because its an intensifier for both sides. If the Democrats can succeed in delaying this does it help or hurt them in November? So, McConnell is basically saying we're gonna run this nomination we're going to get it through here in three months and we're gonna be done it's gonna be over before the election.

Fox News's Lilian Huang Woo gets tips from author Jenn Segal and Famous Dave Anderson. LISTEN HERE:\n\nJuicy Steakhouse Burgers\n\nWHO DOESN'T LOVE a big, tender, juicy steakhouse burger? Problem is, they're difficult to replicate at home because most steakhouses blend different cuts of beef--like sirloin, chuck, and short ribs--to customize the flavor and fat content of their burgers. It's certainly possible to grind your own meat or ask your butcher for a special blend, but it's not always practical. Fortunately, there's an easier way. By combining ordinary supermarket ground beef with a panade and lots of seasoning, you can make sensational steakhouse-style burgers in no time. These burgers have made me a star among my children's friends. My daughter's friend Allie sweetly nicknamed them Segal Burgers-- it stuck, and now we all call them that too.\n\nBy Jennifer Segal Servings: 10 Ingredients 2 pieces white sandwich bread, crusts removed and cut into 1/4-inch pieces 1/3 cup low fat milk 2-1/2 teaspoons kosher salt 1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper 3 garlic cloves, minced 1-1/2 tablespoons Worcestershire sauce 2 tablespoons ketchup 3 pounds 85% lean ground beef 3 scallions, finely sliced (optional) Non-flammable cooking spray to grease grill 10 hamburger buns Instructions Preheat the grill to high heat. In a large bowl, mash the bread and milk together with a fork until it forms a chunky paste. Add the salt, pepper, garlic, Worcestershire sauce and ketchup and mix well. Add the ground beef and scallions and break the meat up with your hands. Gently mix everything together until just combined. Do not overmix. Divide the mixture into ten equal portions and form loose balls. Flatten the balls into 3/4-inch patties about 4-1/2 inches around. Form a slight depression in the center of each patty to prevent the burgers from puffing up on the grill.Grease the grill with non-flammable cooking spray. Grill the burgers, covered, until nicely browned on the first side, 2-4 minutes. Flip burgers and continue cooking for a few minutes more until desired doneness is reached. Before serving, toast the buns on the cooler side of the grill if desired.\n\nReprinted from Once Upon a Chef by Jennifer Segal with permission by Chronicle Books, 2018 Juicy Steakhouse Burgers (a.k.a \"Segal Burgers\")\n\nFollow Lilian Woo on Twitter: @LilianNY\n\nClick HERE to listen to more FOX & Food podcasts", "authors": ["Lilian Woo"], "url": "https://radio.foxnews.com/2018/06/22/juicy-burgers/"}, {"title": "Charles Krauthammer, conservative commentator and Pulitzer Prize winner, dead at 68", "text": "Charles Krauthammer, a longtime Fox News contributor, Pulitzer Prize winner, Harvard-trained psychiatrist and best-selling author who came to be known as the dean of conservative commentators, has died.

Secretary of State Mike Pompeo met for nearly three hours Friday with a top North Korean official in Pyongyang to nail down specifics of commitments on denuclearization made at President Donald Trump's summit with leader Kim Jong Un last month. Pompeo has the crucial task of dispelling growing skepticism over how serious Kim is about giving up his nuclear arsenal and translating the upbeat rhetoric following the June 12 summit into concrete action. It's his third trip to the North Korean capital in as many months, and his first since the summit.

His visit to Pyongyang will be his third since April. His high-stakes objective, which analyst Harry Kazianis called his \"Mission: Impossible,\" is to help convert the regime's promises of denuclearization into concrete action that would eliminate the threat posed by Kim Jong Un's nuclear arsenal.\n\nRich Edson, Washington Correspondent for Fox News Channel, is traveling with Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and joined Fox News Radio's Guy Benson and Marie Harf to discuss Pompeo's visit to North Korea.\n\nUpdate on Pompeo's Trip: It's Saturday morning here in Asia and the Secretary of State is over in Pyongyang right now and he's just about to begin his second day of negotiations with the North Korean delegation and senior officials there. We don't have a sense if he's met with Kim Jong Un on this trip today or this afternoon on Saturday before he travels to Tokyo. (1:34)\n\nOn any new details from American side of what specifically they are trying to achieve: We are getting very few details from the U.S. side from the State Department from the administration as to what else North Korea has agreed to. The document that Trump and Kim Jong Un singed last month in Singapore is a very very broad document and the missing details on how North Korea would give up its nuclear program, how the United States would verify that. Also, the U.S. doesn't have a full understanding, according to Secretary of State what North Korea has and where it has it. (3:12)\n\nOn if Pompeo understands how difficult this will be: Oh yeah, and he and his staff definitely understand and appreciate that. They're the ones in these negotiations and they're the ones trying to make this work. (4:43)\n\nOn the part of the trip in Japan: It's showing a united front. Kim Jong Un is in discussions, ongoing discussions and consultations with Xi Jinping, the Chinese president. So, those allies are coordinating.

The interviews involved seven conversations in all - Trump talked to one candidate twice.\n\nEd Whelan, President of the Ethics and Public Policy Center, directs EPPC's program on The Constitution, the Courts, and the Culture. As a contributor to National Review Online's Bench Memos blog, he has been a leading commentator on nominations to the Supreme Court and the lower courts and on issues of constitutional law. Ed joins Fox News Radio's Guy Benson and Marie Harf to discuss the top three finalists for the Supreme Court Justice Nomination.\n\nOn who he is thinks is the front-runner: Well, I'm probably reading a lot of the same reports you are. I think its actually a bit of a black box and I'm hesitate to put too much weight on any of these reports. These reports often suggest that things are shifting day to day. My guess is there really isn't that much change. So, I've gotta say Guy we'll see on Monday. (00:35)\n\nOn the top three Kavanaugh, Kethledge, Barrett: Each is more than acceptable. Each is outstanding. Each should unify Conservative support. (1:53)\n\nOn criticism of Kavanough: Well, I think the criticisms are in a range from weak to meritless. Look, the David Souter mistake is to assume the hypothetical alternative to a real world candidate, who might have things you can contest, is a perfect candidate. That's how we got David Souter. The idea that Bret Kavanaugh or Raymond Kethledge or Amy Barrett would be a David Souter is absurd. (4:24)\n\nOn politics surrounding Supreme Court nomination: The challenge politically for the White House is to keep all of your Republican senators on board. If you do that winning a small handful of Red State Democrats is probably gonna be easy. And frankly, every Republican senator is going to have a strong incentive to support a highly qualified nominee from this president.

I mean the generic ballot has been the closest its been all cycle. Even in the in-district polling we're seeing that its tightening. Actually some of the in-district polling looks good for us and not just the head-to-head generic ballot. We're talking about the president doing a rally in Montana. His approval ratings 47 to 52 in a lot of these districts. These people feel good about where the economy is going. So, that 24 number, with 23 of them in Clinton districts it sounds pretty easy but for the Democrats the roadmap getting there is quite hard. (1:03)\n\nOn what makes him confident that Democrats have a tough battle: Number one, I'll say the Democrat party is moving far to the left.

It's based on either conventional wisdom or some tangible trend that they can try to point to in some of these districts. (7:14)\n\nOn enthusiasm gap: Quite frankly yes, I am worried about the enthusiasm gap. Look the Democrats have a turned key operation. They have to do nothing for these guys to show up and they do in huge numbers.

And I understand the passion behind the pro-life movement.\n\nTomi Lahren: 'Dems Want Open Borders', They Should 'Just Come Out and Admit It'\n\nBut to use conservatives\u2019 new-found power and pull to challenge a decision that -- according to a new Quinnipiac poll -- most Americans support, would be a mistake.\n\nThis president is winning for the American people on the economy, foreign policy, and tax reform. These are areas that benefit ALL Americans, regardless of religion or social beliefs.\n\nIf we continue to focus on those things - and immigration - we\u2019ll sail into 2020 with all three government branches in our control. That\u2019s how we get things done for the American people. That\u2019s how we win.\n\nLet\u2019s go after sanctuary cities, and push for voter ID laws. We lose when we start messing with social issues.\n\nConsider this: When Supreme Court Justice Neil Gorsuch got to his confirmation hearings with the Senate Judiciary Committee, he was grilled on the so-called \u201cTrump litmus test\u201d on abortion. He responded by telling Sen. Lindsey Graham he would have \u201cwalked out the door\u201d if Trump had asked him to overturn Roe.\n\nEven if conservatives decide to go for the Roe v. Wade jugular, it\u2019s unlikely to succeed. Legal tradition makes it harder to overturn a past decision - unless there are strong grounds for doing so.\n\nAnd a departure from precedent like Roe - which has since been upheld by other cases - is even harder to come by. During his hearing, Justice Gorsuch made a point of noting the decision had already been reaffirmed several times.\n\nDo we really want to fight for this, alienate Democrats, moderates, and libertarians, all to lose in the end anyway? That\u2019s a risk I don\u2019t think is worth taking.\n\nI\u2019m saying this as someone who would personally choose life, but also feels it\u2019s not the government\u2019s place to dictate. This isn\u2019t a black and white issue and I would never judge anyone in that position.\n\nI believe the way to encourage someone to choose life is to treat her with compassion, understanding and love, not government regulation.\n\nLet\u2019s be honest - the federal government does few things well, and I believe regulating social issues is an area where it fails. Let the churches, the non-profits, and the community groups step in, not almighty Uncle Sam.\n\nThose are my Final Thoughts. Feel free to disagree.

Here are just some of the things our ICE agents did to protect us in 2017:\n\nThey seized nearly a million pounds of narcotics \u2013 more than 980,000.

Of all the useless government organizations the liberals celebrate, they target law enforcement? That says a lot about the priorities of the modern-day Democratic Party.\n\nIt\u2019s ironic, really. The nations these illegal immigrants are fleeing are the kind of nations \u201cDemocratic Socialists\u201d like Bernie Sanders and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez dream of.

Then they won\u2019t be separated. Pretty simple.\n\nIt\u2019s time for Final Thoughts.\n\nYou should know that the U.N. group that slammed the U.S. border policy includes some of the world\u2019s most repressive countries and regimes. So, for starters, maybe they should focus on their own horrid human rights records.\n\nNonetheless, a spokeswoman for the U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights told reporters this week \"the U.S. should immediately halt this practice of separating families and stop criminalizing what should at most be an administrative offense.\u201d She went on to say the practice \u201camounts to arbitrary and unlawful interference in family life.\u201d\n\nTomi Lahren on CA: The Golden State Is 'Turning Into a Golden Disaster'\n\nTomi Lahren: Trump Supporters Should Not Justify Roseanne's 'Indefensible' Tweet\n\nExcuse me?! Let me get this straight. The U.S. should stop protecting our borders because it\u2019s a hindrance to the illegal immigrants' family life?! What about American families - families that rely on safe and secure borders? Don't we matter?\n\nNo one likes the idea of separating children from their families. And the best way to make sure this doesn\u2019t happen is to keep people - of ALL ages - from crossing the border ILLEGALLY!\n\nHello! Why is this such a hard concept to understand?!\n\nIt's not just the U.N. The ACLU has also filed a lawsuit on the family separations.\n\nBut the Trump administration has made it clear: We have a ZERO TOLERANCE policy for illegal border crossings. That\u2019s not mean. That\u2019s not inhumane. That\u2019s BORDER ENFORCEMENT.\n\nYou\u2019d think the Democrats would understand that. They rarely meet regulations they don\u2019t like. Why are border and immigration regulations any different?\n\nImagine if they spent half as much time focusing on border security as they do gun safety? Perhaps we wouldn\u2019t be in this predicament.\n\nTake the case of the pizza delivery man from New York who was detained last week at a military base, and now faces deportation. Many of us feel tremendous compassion for the man, Pablo Villavicencio. But he defied a voluntary departure order in 2010, and was therefore considered \u201can ICE fugitive.\u201d\n\nNo one wants to see him taken away from his family, and deported back to Ecuador. But how are we to handle this crisis if we keep bending the rules? As much as I feel for that family, I also feel for the thousands of immigrant families who spend time and money to do it the right way.\n\nWe all agree we need immigration reform. But instead of aiding, abetting and applauding illegal immigrants, how about we send the message, loud and clear, \u201cOUR BORDER WILL BE ENFORCED.\u201d\n\nDon\u2019t journey through Mexico with your children. Don\u2019t put yourselves at risk. And don\u2019t blame the United States or President Trump when you get here and are detained or prosecuted.\n\nEvery nation has the right to enforce its borders. Why do some believe the U.S. should be any different? Yes, we're a nation of immigrants - but we're also one of laws. Get with the program, or face the consequences.\n\nThose are my Final Thoughts.

Sticking with the athletic theme, I'm super \"outdoorsy.\" I climbed Mt. Sinai in Egypt in 2009 with my brother.\n\nAnd a few years ago, I climbed the majority of a Grand Canyon trail down and back in one day. I had to scrap a few miles or I would have run out of daylight, but both of those accomplishments are things I will never forget... probably because I was in pain for days!\n\n4. My very first job was as a cashier at O'Neill's Food Market in Glenside, Pennsylvania. I proudly wore that green uniform!

I wore three sets of braces because my teeth were so bad. My teeth were really separated when I was young.\n\nOne set actually ended up breaking, but it all worked out and now I love my smile!\n\n4. My friend and co-worker Geraldo Rivera was one of my daughter's first babysitters, when I brought her into Fox News Channel for her first TV appearance after she was born.\n\nHe watched Hayden in the hallway outside the studio while I was inside. I remember thinking that it was so cool that Geraldo, who I used to watch on TV, was babysitting my daughter for me.\n\n5. When I was a little girl I went with my family to Washington, D.C. for a basketball tournament. My dad was the coach.\n\nWe toured the city and saw the space museum and all the monuments, including the White House.\n\nHere I am all these years later, anchoring the #1 morning show on cable news, getting an opportunity to speak to the President of the United States and visiting the Oval Office!\n\nIn her new book, The Light Within Me: An Inspirational Memoir, Ainsley offers a powerful, uplifting look at her life and her spiritual journey, reflecting on her family, her faith, and her successful career.\n\nShowing Hayden some of the pictures in my new book, \u201cThe Light Within Me,\u201d available tomorrow! #TheLightWithinMe @foxandfriends pic.twitter.com/JCyrnscJah \u2014 Ainsley Earhardt (@ainsleyearhardt) April 23, 2018\n\nSee more about your favorite Fox News hosts...\n\nJudge Jeanine\n\nTomi Lahren\n\nShannon Bream\n\nSandra Smith\n\nHarris Faulkner", "authors": ["Ainsley Earhardt"], "url": "http://insider.foxnews.com/2018/05/03/ainsley-earhardt-5-things-you-didnt-know-facts-photos-family"}, {"title": "5 Things You Didn't Know About Carley Shimkus", "text": "Fox News Insider set the alarm to catch up with one of the fresh faces of Fox News Channel's live morning coverage.\n\nNew Jersey native Carley Shimkus shared some fun facts about her family, how she started at Fox News Channel and her love of Michigan football.\n\n1. My parents met on an airplane in 1982. My mom was a flight attendant for United Airlines and my dad was a passenger.\n\nShe jokes it would have been love at first sight if not for his polyester shirt. I also have an older sister who is an incredible artist and art teacher.\n\n2. My career at Fox News started even before I graduated college. I worked as an intern at the D.C. bureau in 2008.\n\nI had such a good experience that I decided to apply for a job after graduation.\n\n3. I met my husband, Pete, on my 23rd birthday.\n\nWe got married in August, 2015 in my home state of New Jersey. \u200e\n\nWe are both diehard Michigan football fans and even walked out to the Michigan fight song on our wedding day. Go Blue!!\n\n4. One of the most frequently asked questions I get on social media is about my height. I\u2019m 5\u201910\u2019\u2019 but heels, of course, elevate me a few more inches.\n\nHere I am with one of my best friends on her wedding day...\n\n5. Because of my height, I figured I\u2019d give modeling a try when I was in high school.\n\nIt was a fun experience but not in the cards for me.\n\nHere I am in an ad for a costume store.

It\u2019s a great escape, and I don\u2019t really care if I actually catch any fish \u2013 which is why my husband claims I always do!\n\nPlaying Piano and Composing Music: I was a kid who tried everything from gymnastics to drama classes. When I sat at the piano keyboard at five years old, something clicked. It felt so familiar, like I wasn\u2019t learning something new as much as I was finding my way home. I find playing, and now composing, to be very therapeutic.\n\nQuiet Time: My days go much better when I start the day reading, studying the Bible and praying. It reminds me what is truly important, to stay humble and to serve the people around me. It also centers me when life throws curveballs \u2013 as it so often does.\n\nThis is my favorite spot to relax at home...\n\nCollege Football: Something about cheering for my FSU Seminoles drives me into psycho territory. Even my closest friends are a tad embarrassed to attend the games with me. If you can\u2019t scream your lungs out in a stadium full of 50,000 people \u2013 where can you?!\n\nMy Happy Place: There is no place on Earth I love more than being at the beach. It doesn\u2019t matter if it\u2019s stormy and cold or sunny without a cloud in the sky, that\u2019s where I want to be. I grew up on the ocean, and being there immediately brings back the happiest memories and the deepest calm.\n\nBonus fact: Shannon and the crew often turn the \"Fox News @ Night\" studio in Washington, D.C. into a post-show dance party, as we recently learned from Janice Dean.\n\nWatch Shannon Bream each weeknight LIVE at 11pm ET on Fox News Channel!\n\nSee more about your favorite Fox News hosts...\n\nJudge Jeanine\n\nTomi Lahren\n\nSandra Smith\n\nHarris Faulkner", "authors": [], "url": "http://insider.foxnews.com/2018/01/31/5-things-you-didnt-know-about-shannon-bream"}, {"title": "5 Things You Didn't Know About Tomi Lahren", "text": "Final Thoughts: A Christmas Message for Melting Snowflakes\n\nFox News fans already know Tomi Lahren from her viral Final Thoughts videos.\n\nNow Fox News Insider has caught up with the UNLV alum for the inside scoop on her upbringing, how she comes up with those fiery commentaries and more.\n\nSee what Tomi had to say below...\n\nI have a chihuahua mutt named Kota. I rescued her from the Dallas Humane Society two years ago. She\u2019s as spunky as I am and doesn\u2019t take \"no\" for an answer. Rescue animals have a special place in my heart.\n\nMy family has always chosen adoption over the pet store and I hope you do too!\n\nMy parents have been married for 36 years this June. I wouldn\u2019t be where I am in this world without their constant love and support. They taught me that anything worth doing is worth doing right.\n\nI credit my public speaking abilities to my parents. They never talked baby talk to me. I think that\u2019s why I\u2019ve always been able to speak and write well.\n\nRunning is my exercise of choice. I run seven miles each and every morning. It is on my runs where I am able to clear my head and plan for the day. I often come up with my Final Thoughts on these morning runs and I even stop to type notes and one-liners into my phone en route! I also come up with some of my best tweets when I run.\n\nI am blessed to live near the beach in sunny Southern California. There\u2019s something about that ocean and salty air that makes the seven miles suck less. My running addiction has left me with some pretty gnarly scars on my knees but hey, when you run nearly 50 miles a week a few tumbles are bound to happen.\n\nI\u2019ve recently started doing Cryotherapy for my knees and ankles. Fingers crossed it\u2019ll do the trick and keep me on my toes!\n\nMy parents both come from ranching families. Although we didn\u2019t have a ranch when I was growing up, we did have horses.\n\nThere\u2019s nothing like growing up with wide open spaces, fresh air, and horses grazing the pasture. Living out in the country is also a great place to practice my Second Amendment freedoms.\n\nI have two tattoos. I got my first tattoo on my 21st birthday. I designed it myself. It is a wheat leaf crossed with the state flower of South Dakota, the pasque flower.\n\nIt\u2019s a reminder of where I came from.\n\nMy second tattoo is a roman numeral 11 with a semicolon. Eleven is my lucky number. It shows up constantly and randomly in my everyday life.\n\nThe semicolon is a reminder to keep going when I could easily stop.
