Saman Gunan was returning from a mission to provide the group with air tanks when he ran out of oxygen.\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Rescue diver in Thai cave: \"I was very scared\"\n\nAged between about 11 and 17, the members of the Wild Boars football team had entered the Tham Luang cave system in the province of Chiang Rai during an excursion with their coach.\n\nConfirming the completion of the rescue operation, the Thai Navy Seals Facebook page announced: \"All 12 Wild Boars and coach have been extracted from the cave. All are safe.\"\n\nAnd at the house just below the mountains where the men who run the Wild Boars meet, there was laughter, shouts and cheers - and people shook hands in a very un-Thai way, says the BBC Jonathan Head.\n\n'Mission Accomplished'\n\nBy Nick Beake, at Chiang Rai hospital\n\nThis is the moment Mission Impossible became Mission Accomplished.\n\nFamilies in Chiang Rai gathered at the hospital to watch the final ambulances bring in their precious cargo. Some said they couldn't believe it, others said they had never lost hope. All wore the brightest of smiles.\n\nUp on the eighth floor, doctors - who declared this morning that the first eight boys to be rescued are doing well - will now be examining their remaining team mates and their coach. Psychologists will be assessing the impact a fortnight trapped underground has had.\n\nThe Wild Boars footballers went into the Tham Luang cave as a team. They survived as a team. And tonight, at the end of a remarkable 72-hour rescue, they are together as a team once again.\n\nHow were they rescued?\n\nA team of 90 expert divers - 40 from Thailand and 50 from overseas - worked in the Tham Luang caves.\n\nThey guided the boys and their coach through darkness and submerged passageways towards the mouth of the cave system.\n\nGetting to and from the trapped group was an exhausting round trip, even for experienced divers.\n\nThe process included a mixture of walking, wading, climbing and diving along guide ropes.\n\nWearing full-face masks, which are easier for novice divers than traditional respirators, each boy was accompanied by two divers, who also carried his air supply.\n\nThe toughest part was about halfway out at a section named \"T-Junction\", which was so tight that the divers had to take off their air tanks to get through.\n\nBeyond that a cavern - called Chamber 3 - was turned into a forward base for the divers.\n\nThere the boys could rest before making the last, easier walk out to the entrance. They were then taken to hospital in Chiang Rai.\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Wife and father remember 'hero' Thai diver: \"He loved helping others\"\n\nThe last of the rescue team - three Thai Navy Seals and a doctor - emerged from the cave complex some hours after the last member of the trapped group was released.\n\nWho are the boys and their coach?\n\nDetails have emerged of members of the team and their coach.\n\nCaptain Duganpet Promtep, 13, is described as a motivator and highly respected by his teammates. He had apparently been scouted by several Thai professional clubs.\n\nMyanmar-born Adul Sam-on, 14, speaks several languages, and was the only team member to be able to communicate with British divers when they were first discovered.\n\nIt was 17-year-old Peerapat Sompiangjai's birthday when the group became trapped in the cave. The snacks the boys brought with them to celebrate are likely to have helped them survive their ordeal.\n\nAssistant coach Ekapol Chantawong, 25, was said to be the weakest of the group when they were found, as he had reportedly refused to eat any of the food and gave it instead to the boys.\n\nWhat next for the boys?\n\nThe first eight boys to be rescued - on Sunday and Monday - are still in hospital but said to be in good mental and physical health.\n\nThey have undergone X-rays and blood tests, and will remain under observation in hospital for at least seven days.\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Child psychiatrist: \"It will be a challenge for these children to go back to normal life\"\n\nTheir parents have been allowed to see them through a glass window at the hospital, but they are being quarantined.\n\nDrinking contaminated water in the cave or being exposed to bird or bat droppings in the cave could lead to dangerous infections, experts say.\n\nThe boys lost weight during their time in the caves and are keen to eat. They are said to have requested a favourite pork dish, bread and chocolate, but solid food will have to be reintroduced slowly to prevent digestive upset.\n\nThey will also need to wear sunglasses for a few days until their eyes readjust to the brighter light.\n\nOffers of hospitality for the football team have come in from around the world:\n\nGlobal football body Fifa offered the 12 young footballers tickets for Sunday's World Cup final in Moscow, but they are too weak to travel.\n\nPortuguese club Benfica has invited the boys and their coach an all-expenses-paid week at its training academy.\n\nManchester United - the English club several of the boys support - has offered them the chance to attend a game.\n\nEngland players including Manchester City defender Kyle Walker are sending football kit to the boys after one of them was pictured wearing an England shirt inside the caves.", "authors": [], "url": "http://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-44782132"}, {"title": "BBC News", "text": "How a US-China trade war could hurt us all\n\nThe US and China are at the beginning of a trade war - and no-one knows just how bad it could get.", "authors": [], "url": "http://www.bbc.com/news/world/asia"}, {"title": "Trump: What does the US do for the Nato alliance in Europe?", "text": "Image copyright AFP Image caption US forces take part regularly in Nato exercises\n\nPresident Trump says the US is being \"taken advantage of\" by other members of the Nato alliance, which was set up in 1949 to counter the Soviet Union.\n\nShortly before leaving for the Nato summit, he said other members should increase their financial contributions.\n\nBut the President of the European Council, Donald Tusk, hit back by saying that the US had no better ally than Europe.\n\nSkip Twitter post by @eucopresident Dear @realDonaldTrump. US doesn\u2019t have and won\u2019t have a better ally than EU. We spend on defense much more than Russia and as much as China. I hope you have no doubt this is an investment in our security, which cannot be said with confidence about Russian & Chinese spending :-) \u2014 Donald Tusk (@eucopresident) July 10, 2018 Report\n\nIn 2014, all Nato members agreed to increase their defence spending to 2% of GDP (gross domestic product, the total value of goods produced and services provided) by 2024.\n\nThe US currently spends more than 3.5% of its GDP on defence. Among European members, Greece, the UK and Estonia spend over 2%.\n\nBut Nato says it expects the number who spend at least 2% to increase to eight this year.\n\nWhat does the US contribute in terms of forces in Europe and where are they based?\n\nAt the height of the Cold War, there were more than 400,000 US military personnel in Europe. Today, the US has more than 60,000 in Europe, including Turkey.\n\nGermany currently hosts by far the largest number of US forces, followed by Italy, the UK and Spain.\n\nThese personnel also support other non-Nato operations such as the US Africa Command, which has its HQ in Stuttgart, in Germany, as well as the US Transport Command (based in the US), which organises the movement of forces and materiel around the world.\n\nHowever, US military numbers fluctuate as forces are rotated in and out of the European theatre at any given time.\n\nLarge numbers of US troops pass through Europe each year - either for a lengthy stay or for short-term exercises to reassure Nato allies concerned about Russia.\n\nOne of the biggest in years, Trident Juncture 2018, is planned for October in Norway and the north Atlantic - and the US will play an important role.\n\nAnother key part of the US's commitment to the defence of Europe is the European Reassurance Initiative, launched after Russia's intervention in Ukraine in 2014.\n\nDespite Mr Trump's warnings about the level of US financial commitment to Nato, the US is planning to increase the budget for this by 40% in 2018, to $4.7bn, up from $789m in 2016 under President Obama.\n\nIt's also worth remembering that the US has global military commitments. In fact, the largest single deployment of forces is not in Europe but in Japan.\n\nThere are also significant numbers in South Korea and in Afghanistan, where the US contributes to the Nato-led mission there.", "authors": [], "url": "https://www.bbc.com/news/world-44717074"}, {"title": "BBC News", "text": "Mexican grandfather 'assaulted with brick'\n\nA woman in California allegedly hit him in the face with a brick and said \"go back to your country\".", "authors": ["Katya Adler", "Europe Editor", "Jonathan Amos", "Bbc Science Correspondent"], "url": "http://www.bbc.com/news/world"}, {"title": "US mum and daughter 'questioned over different surnames'", "text": "Image copyright Sylvia Acosta Image caption Dr Acosta was asked to prove her daughter was hers despite having her passport\n\nUS Customs and Border Protection has disputed a claim that one of its employees asked a woman to prove that she was the mother of her daughter.\n\nTexas mum Sylvia Acosta and her 15-year-old daughter, Sybonae Castillo, were both asked why they didn't share the same last name.\n\nDr Acosta says she was \"interrogated\" on Sunday at Dallas-Fort Worth airport.\n\nA CBP spokesperson said the video of the encounter \"does not support\" the claim.\n\n'One said I should consider changing my name'\n\nDr Acosta, who is chief executive of the Young Women's Christian Association, and her daughter had been on a tour of Europe when they arrived back to Texas on Sunday.\n\n\"There was a huge line of people,\" Dr Acosta said. \"We walked up to the customs officer.

So how are millennials in just one country bucking this trend?\n\nIt\u2019s old news that university debts and rocketing housing costs are common concerns for people born between the early 1980s and the early 2000s, living in the US, the UK and many other countries. Multiple studies suggest this group will be the first in recorded history to end up poorer than those which came before.\n\nPeople in their early thirties in Norway have an average annual disposable household income of around 460,000 kronor - around $56,200\n\nBut perhaps this doesn\u2019t have to be a foregone conclusion.\n\nIn Europe\u2019s northernmost country, things are decidedly different.\n\nBest known for its Viking history, snow sports and jaw-dropping fjords, Norway is making a new name for itself as the only major economy in Europe where young people are getting markedly richer.\n\nPeople in their early thirties in Norway have an average annual disposable household income of around 460,000 kronor (around $56,200).\n\nYoung Norwegians have enjoyed a 13% rise in disposable household income in real terms compared to Generation X (those born between 1966 and 1980) when they were the same age. These startling figures come from the largest comparative wealth data set in the world, the Luxembourg Income Database, and were analysed in a recent report on generational incomes for the UK Think Tank The Resolution Foundation.\n\nCompare this with young people in other strong economies: US millennials have experienced a 5% dip, in Germany it\u2019s a 9% drop. For those living in southern Europe (the southern Eurozone suffered the brunt of the global economic crisis in 2008), disposable incomes have plunged by as much as 30%.\n\nNorway\u2019s youth unemployment rate (among 15- to 29-year-olds) is also relatively low at 9.4% compared to an OECD average of 13.9%.\n\n\u2018A lucky situation\u2019\n\nOn a rare scorching day in the Norwegian capital Oslo, it\u2019s not difficult to find young locals who embody the country\u2019s good fortunes.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t really think about how I spend my money,\u201d says Aleksander Aarnes, a 25-year-old graduate.\n\n\u201cI go to the theatre about once a month, go to the cinema once a month. I can go out and eat and drink with friends... I go on vacation (holiday).\u201d\n\nAarnes is pursuing a career writing for musical theatre, but is yet to earn anything for his efforts, so he funds his lifestyle by working just one or two shifts a week in a supermarket in Korsvoll, a sleepy suburb dotted with large detached pastel-coloured wooden houses. He shares an apartment with a friend in another suburb about a 20-minute bus ride from the city centre.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m really aware of the lucky situation I am in... I don\u2019t have to sacrifice too much to pursue the career I want,\u201d he says.\n\nAarnes\u2019 hourly pay starts at 164 Norwegian kronor (around $20), increasing for weekend and evening shifts. After taxes (which are comparatively high in Scandinavia) he\u2019s left with around 14,000 kronor ($1700) a month, of which he sets aside half for rent, travel and bills and uses the rest for \u201cwhatever else\u201d he likes.\n\nFurther down the road in Korsvoll, a 31-year-old business analyst called \u00d8ystein is packing his BMW with supplies for a barbecue. He doesn\u2019t want to share his full name, arguing that \u201ceven though Norway is rich, people don\u2019t really want to talk about how rich they are personally.\u201d But he admits he earnt enough to buy a two-bedroom apartment on the waterfront when he was 27 and regularly goes on holiday to the US and Asia.\n\nWhat\u2019s Norway doing differently?\n\nA huge part of young Norwegians\u2019 fantastic lifestyle is down to the country\u2019s rapid economic growth. After seeing the biggest increase in average earnings of any large high-income economy between 1980 and 2013, it now leads multiple global rankings for wealth and wellbeing. It weathered the global recession well.\n\nLast year it came top of the 2017 Legatum Prosperity Index, which analyses 110 countries around the world.\n\nNorway\u2019s huge oil and gas sector is the clear driving factor behind the nation\u2019s economic boom over the last three decades, following major discoveries in the North Sea (although falling energy prices in recent years have had an impact).\n\nBut as Hilde Bj\u00f8rnland, an economics professor based at BI Norwegian Business school in Oslo explains, it is not just how much money Norway makes that\u2019s significant, but what it does with it.\n\n\u201cIt has managed the oil [money] well in that it is saving, and using a portion of that to put back into society,\u201d she says. \u201cSo rather than a few getting a lot, many people have access to this wealth.\u201d\n\nNorway has done this by storing its money in the world\u2019s largest sovereign wealth fund. In simple terms, this is a giant savings pot which makes money by investing in more than 9000 companies. It is currently worth around $1 trillion.\n\nIn spite of this savings pot, taxes are kept high and the country has a compressed wage structure, which means minimum salaries are negotiated by unions.\n\n\u201cYoung people and people in lower-paid industries have [experienced] the growth rates in their wages each year... and the differences between those who earn a little and those who earn a lot are not so large as in other countries,\u201d says Bj\u00f8rnland.\n\nThe Resolution Foundation\u2019s report on generational income concludes that rising inequality has been a core factor in driving down disposable incomes for millennials in other strong economies such as the US, UK and Germany. In these countries, where there are wider wage bands, young people bear the brunt of a lack of pay growth and job mobility.\n\nBy contrast, Bj\u00f8rnland argues that an egalitarian approach \u2013 distributing wealth between generations \u2013 has contributed to strong life satisfaction and a lack of social unrest in Norway.\n\nHigh welfare payments and heavily subsidised health care also help when it comes to pitting Norwegian millennials' prospects against those elsewhere in Europe. Unemployment benefits are generous: allowing many people to claim around 60% of their previous salary for two years, while they are looking for new work. As in all the Nordic countries, low childcare costs and a general parental leave system also ensure a high participation of women in the workforce.\n\nI have to pay a lot of taxes, but I don\u2019t really care, because I know that the state gives you so many things at the same time \u2013 Gabriella Sanzana\n\nFree education at most schools and public universities and easy access to loans (which borrowers don\u2019t pay interest on while they are studying) alongside high employment rates for students are also part of the jigsaw.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a significant factor that while young people are studying, they\u2019re able to have a job on the side,\u201d says Bj\u00f8rnland, who adds that this kind of casual work can often bring in a higher income for young people in Norway than those in other western countries.\n\nHer sentiment is shared by many of the throngs of students cooling off in the \u00c5kerselva river just a few metres from the shiny glass buildings that dominate the business school\u2019s campus.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not that difficult to find a job here and they\u2019re always really well-paid. So it helps a lot, to cover your leisure life and your studies,\u201d says Gabriella Sanzana, a 27-year-old from Chile, who\u2019s doing a master\u2019s in human rights while working part-time as a waitress.\n\n\u201cI have to pay a lot of taxes, but I don\u2019t really care, because I know that [the state] gives you so many things at the same time.\u201d\n\nA secure future?\n\nDespite Norway\u2019s glowing CV, there are concerns about sustaining its success.\n\nHigh youth employment is declining, according to Investing in Youth: Norway, a recent OECD report, which states that the number of job opportunities for 15 to 29-year-olds doesn\u2019t match up with the amount needed for a swelling youth population, which rose by 18% between 2007 and 2016.\n\nImmigration accounted for over four-fifths of this increase and unemployment among Norway\u2019s foreign-born population is currently around 10%.\n\nKristian Heggeb\u00f8, a senior researcher at the Centre for Labour and Welfare Research at Oslo Metropolitan University, argues that while well-educated international students and labour migrants from elsewhere in Europe \u201ctend to do well on the jobs market,\u201d there are persistently high levels of \u201clabour market discrimination against ethnic minorities.\u201d\n\nFor the young Norwegians who are disadvantaged and have social issues, finding their spot in society can be much harder\n\n\u201cTo some extent it could be [because of] a lack of qualifications, but there is no doubt in my mind that the issue is on the demand side and not the supply side,\u201d he says.\n\nHeggeb\u00f8 argues that there is \u201cfirm empirical evidence\u201d which demonstrates that despite rising immigration over the past two decades, many Norwegian employers are still \u201csceptical towards hiring someone with a non-Norwegian background.\u201d Even second generation immigrants born and educated in a Nordic country can end up struggling to gain access to the labour market, he says, suggesting that anonymous CVs in the first stages of recruitment could be a crucial part of the solution.\n\nFragmented society\n\nPreparing to catch the train home after a day in the sweltering city centre, Ove George, who\u2019s from Nigeria and is currently unemployed, says he believes networking is often the key to getting work in Norway, something that can be tricky for foreigners without Norwegian connections.\n\n\u201cThe last job I got was through a Norwegian friend I had, and after that I haven\u2019t really got a good job,\u201d he explains.\n\nAlso at the station is 19-year-old Djibouti-born Kayad Mahammed, who currently works for a media company. He says he\u2019s \u201cnot struggling\u201d and personally found it \u201ceasy\u201d to get a job. But he adds that he believes \u201cit\u2019s hard to get rich\u201d for many immigrants, who can wind up clinging onto entry-level jobs for fear of ending up unemployed again.\n\nMeanwhile, despite the Scandinavian country\u2019s pride over its egalitarianism, there are signs inequality is rising within the wider population, too.\n\nOECD figures suggest that the share of Norwegians earning less than half the national average income was 8.1% in 2015, up from 6.9% in 2004, with young people more at risk than any other group. (Although, put this into context, this is still low by global standards \u2013 the proportion in the US is 16.8% and 10.9% in the UK.)\n\nThose who end up outside of employment, training or education altogether can often feel more vulnerable in Norway than they might in other countries, argues Sebastian K\u00f6nigs, one of the authors of the OECD\u2019s Investing in Youth: Norway report.\n\n\u201cFor the young Norwegians who are disadvantaged and have social issues, finding their spot in society can be much harder,\u201d he says. \u201cBecause generally speaking everyone is doing so well in society, this becomes a stigma.\u201d\n\nThis cohort is six times more likely to feel depressed than other young Norwegians, nine times as likely to suffer from poor health and more at risk of remaining outside the labour market for the long term, according to OECD figures.\n\nThe price of success\n\nAccording to Bj\u00f8rnland, even the wealthiest Norwegians should be wary of its fragility moving forward.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re used to having a good time, you\u2019re used to taking long weekends... if you\u2019ve had it like this for a long time you take it for granted,\u201d she says. \u201cBut things which have happened in the past might not happen again.\u201d\n\nThis isn\u2019t about the size of the country, this is about how much resources you\u2019re willing to invest in it... Norway perceives this to be a central priority, and it should be\n\nShe argues that Norway needs to work harder to diversify its industries in order to remain competitive in future. This might include expanding its technology, raw material and renewable energy sectors, all alongside an emerging start-up scene. It has grown quickly in recent years but still lags behind its Nordic neighbours.\n\nEmployers will also have to be more open to attracting international talent to fill the jobs created outside its oil and gas sector, she suggests. On the other hand, young Norwegians \u201cused to being able to work wherever they like\u201d may need to become increasingly \u201cfocused on where the skills are needed\u201d in order to maintain the same standard of living as millennials entering the workforce today.\n\nSolutions?\n\nDespite Norway\u2019s current challenges, many experts believe that there is still a huge amount that other nations can learn.\n\nAt the OECD, Sebastian K\u00f6nigs cites much closer links between education, employment and social services than in most other countries as an effective way of supporting young people in the early stages of their careers. Every Norwegian school leaver gets a personal follow-up phone call to discuss their options if they don\u2019t enter the employment market or pursue further studies, for example.\n\nHe argues that while Norway\u2019s population is just 5.1 million, larger nations could still replicate these policies if they wanted to.\n\n\u201cThis isn\u2019t about the size of the country, this is about how much resources you\u2019re willing to invest in it... Norway perceives this to be a central priority, and it should be.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, Kristian Heggeb\u00f8 says he believes that even if oil is taken \u201ctotally out of the equation\u201d and Norway is forced to reshape its economy in the future, it will continue to prosper as a result of its egalitarian approach and safety net for young people.\n\n\u201cIf we keep these components in place then I\u2019m willing to bet everything that I own that we will still be performing at a very, very high level compared to other European countries, simply because we have a way [to deal with] difficulties that is more humane.\u201d\n\n--\n\nTo comment on this story or anything else you have seen on BBC Capital, please head over to our Facebook page or message us on Twitter.\n\nIf you liked this story, sign up for the weekly bbc.com features newsletter called \"If You Only Read 6 Things This Week\".

A pair of young male servers are gliding through the restaurant, juggling plates groaning with roast chicken and frites, duck confit and beef tartare, and sliding them across the tables to their customers in swift but graceful movements.\n\nSitting in the corner of the bar, a lone man has ordered a cheese plate, a green salad and a glass of red wine, and is consumed by his newspaper. It\u2019s not long before a tall, middle-aged man enters the restaurant, calls out \u2018Georges\u2019, shakes his hand with a hearty one-two pump and takes the seat next to him. It\u2019s immediately apparent that Georges\u2019 friend is the kind of bar fixture who has the gift of banter.\n\nYou may also be interested in:\n\n\u2022 The end to a French cheese tradition?\n\n\u2022 Spain\u2019s untranslatable secret to lunch\n\n\u2022 Ireland\u2019s secret to a low-key life\n\n\u201cWhen are you going to take my order?\u201d he teases the bartender in an accusatory tone.\n\n\u201cHuh la la la la,\u201d she replies, her four \u201clas\u201d uttered in quick succession. \u201cAlways the same. You haven\u2019t changed.\u201d\n\nShe would know. Marie-Claude Lainey has been serving Serge Jovanovic his lunch for the last 15 years.\n\nJovanovic and Georges Cano have also been eating their lunches together over the last 15 years. In the same bistro. At the same time. Nearly every day.\n\nAt Le Bistrot du Peintre, while every customer who crosses the threshold is greeted with a bright and cheerful \u2018bonjour\u2019, the regulars are welcomed by name and outstretched hands for quick, firm handshakes or customary French cheek-to-cheek kisses.\n\nIt\u2019s this uniquely Parisian culture that Alain Fontaine wants to preserve and protect. The chef and restaurateur has launched a high-profile campaign seeking Unesco Intangible Cultural Heritage status for the \u2018art de vivre\u2019 (art of living) found in bistros and cafe terraces throughout Paris.\n\nBecause over the past few decades, this social institution has come under threat, Fontaine laments, displaced by what he describes as an increasingly connected \u2013 and disconnected \u2013 world.\n\nAround 30 years ago, bistros represented about half of all restaurants in Paris, says Fontaine, whose initiative has the support of trade unions, city hall, journalists and artists.\n\nThe bistro bar is a place of exchange, of conversation, a way of life\n\nToday, he says that figure has dropped to 14%.\n\nBy Fontaine\u2019s definition, an authentic bistro is an eatery that\u2019s open continuously morning to night, serves French comfort foods at moderate prices, and houses an active bar where locals can gather for a drink and some lively conversation.\n\n\u201cThe bistro bar is a place of exchange, of conversation, a way of life,\u201d he explained at his own Paris bistro Le Mesturet. \u201cYou can have a blue-collar worker elbow-to-elbow with a CEO and an office worker, sharing a coffee, a glass of wine, discussing everything and nothing. Anyone can afford bistro prices, erasing all socio-economic lines.\u201d\n\nJovanovic and Cano illustrate Fontaine\u2019s point perfectly. They met as fellow diners at Le Bistrot du Peintre 15 years ago. But they come from very different walks of life: Jovanovic works in digital marketing and is gregarious and good-humoured. Cano, an artisan bronzesmith, is more soft-spoken, a little reserved.\n\nWere it not for the bistro, it\u2019s unlikely they would have socialised in the same circles.\n\nThe bistro culture has long been part of Parisian mythology, popularised by literary and philosophical greats like Ernest Hemingway, F Scott Fitzgerald, Jean-Paul Sartre and Simone de Beauvoir who made bistros and cafes their second homes and offices.\n\nBut a closer look at its history reveals that the classic Parisian bistro wasn\u2019t started by enterprising Parisians, but by their compatriots from the Auvergne region of south-central France, who uprooted en masse to the French capital during the industrial revolution looking for work.\n\nIn Paris, they would occupy the lowest tiers of society, doing the jobs no-one else wanted: water carriers for public baths, coal delivery and the scrubbing of floors.\n\nEventually, the more entrepreneurial among them would open \u2018coal cafes\u2019 that pulled double duty: the husband would deliver coal, while the wife would sell coffee, wine and beer to her fellow working-class locals. The concept would later evolve to include modest, home-cooked meals at prices the labourers could afford.\n\nIt\u2019s this spirit of congregation that Fontaine is desperate to preserve.\n\nOver the years, he says, the iconic institution has become lost to changing dining habits, foreign influences and new technology.\n\nMultinational fast-food chains like Starbucks, Chipotle, Pret A Manger and most recently Five Guys have planted their flags in the French capital, seducing young people with their trendy, Anglo-Saxon brands. Food delivery services like UberEats and Deliveroo are keeping people at home, and out of restaurants. Sky-high rents have squeezed bistros out almost completely in some parts of Paris.\n\nAnd despite the #tousaubistro (everyonetothebistro) movement after the 2015 terror attacks, businesses were hit hard in the months that followed, according to Fontaine.\n\n\u201cWhat we want to defend is this art de vivre in the bistro that allows us to live together, exchange together, this cultural melting pot.\u201d\n\nHe also rails against the growing \u2018Anglo-Saxon\u2019 influence of desk lunches in French workplaces, part of a larger epidemic in which people are disconnecting from friends and colleagues to eat alone in front of a screen.\n\nFor his part, Jovanovic still believes in observing the sanctity of the French lunch hour.\n\n\u201cThe bistro is my oxygen bubble where I can breathe. I have a job where there\u2019s a lot of pressure, and can be stressful. I come here to clear my head and change my environment.\u201d\n\nAccording to Fontaine, the mark of a true, authentic bistro is the existence of a working bar that invites people to gather together and socialise.\n\nAt the counter, everyone is equal\n\nFor Jovanovic, the bistro\u2019s zinc bar is his preferred dining spot, a place where he can condense a meal and lively conversation into the space of an hour.\n\n\u201cThis is also how I met Georges, at the counter, over the special of the day,\u201d he said.\n\nHerv\u00e9 Bonal, owner of Le Bistrot du Peintre, shares Fontaine\u2019s interpretation of the bar\u2019s role in the community, after having worked behind his for 27 years.\n\n\u201cAt the counter, everyone is equal,\u201d he said. \u201cOften, strangers will end up talking to each other, about everything from the president of the United States, the president of France, the financial crisis, to the latest car that just came out. Everyone has the right to give their opinion. That\u2019s why we call it the people\u2019s parliament.\u201d\n\nAlongside the bistro, the application for Unesco status will also underscore the importance of Paris\u2019 outdoor terraces, where rows of rattan chairs are placed strategically to face out onto the street, turning pavements into open-air theatres.\n\nHere, the show has no beginning and no end, and the cast of characters is constantly changing, be it a woman cradling a bouquet of flowers exiting left or a father holding the hand of his young daughter entering the stage, scene right.\n\nIn French, the spectator sport of people-watching on an outdoor terrace has its own expression: fl\u00e2ner en terrasse. There is an art to it, requiring the practitioner to slow down, sit still and permit themselves the luxury of being idle.\n\nIt\u2019s perhaps the one Parisian experience visitors to the city are quickest to nail down, perhaps because they are quick to understand how diverting and restorative it can be.\n\nOver in the 3rd arrondissement, Sylvia Krouheim has snagged prime real estate on the outdoor terrace of Le Barbouille bistro. It\u2019s a Parisian pastime the German native has happily adopted as a regular weekend ritual while in Paris. The retiree splits her time between Cologne and the French capital.\n\n\u201cI come to have a drink and people-watch,\u201d she said. \u201cWe have cafes in Germany but not this culture of sitting idle and people-watching. I enjoy it.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, to be clear, a bistro is not to be confused with its fancier cousin, the brasserie, Fontaine adds. The brasserie is characterised by ornate, Art Nouveau architecture and decor, linen tablecloths, buttoned up waiters, upscale service \u2013 and the prices to match.\n\nLikewise, the mark of a real neighbourhood bistro is one that is open from morning until night (from 07:00 to 22:00, for example) with continuous service.\n\nTraditional bistro fare is rib-sticking comfort food from the collective French childhood \u2013 beef bourguignon, veal stew, chocolate mousse, cr\u00e8me caramel \u2013 and priced modestly to make it accessible to everyone.\n\nThe cuisine also differs from \u2018bistronomie\u2019, which Fontaine describes as gussied-up bistro food at haute gastronomy prices.\n\nHe emphasises that in the Unesco dossier, food will play little more than a supporting role. Instead, bistros and cafe terraces will be presented as the heart of neighbourhood communities in Paris \u2013 literally, in some cases.\n\nThe bistro is also a common setting for the cinematic \u2018meet cute\u2019. Bonal himself met his wife at the bistro when she was a diner. That was 23 years ago. But it can also serve as the secretive meeting place for illicit lovers. Bonal recounts the time an adulterous couple got caught at his bistro. There were tears, screams and slammed doors, he remembers.\n\nMeanwhile, Fontaine faces some stiff competition for Unesco World Heritage status. Similar campaigns have been mounted for Paris\u2019s iconic grey rooftops and open-air booksellers. Groups have until this autumn to submit their dossier to the Ministry of Culture, which will then choose which cause to present to Unesco in March 2019.\n\nFor bistrotiers, securing Unesco recognition would help restore pride and officialise the bistro\u2019s role in the neighbourhood, says Fontaine.\n\nThe ultimate goal is for younger generations to continue the tradition and for new bistrotiers to keep the art de vivre and original spirit of the bistro alive.\n\nJoin more than three million BBC Travel fans by liking us on Facebook, or follow us on Twitter and Instagram.\n\nIf you liked this story, sign up for the weekly bbc.com features newsletter called \"If You Only Read 6 Things This Week\".

Queer Looks is also a celebration of the seaside city of Brighton and the area around it as a magnet for the gay and lesbian community. References to milestones along the path towards greater global LGBTQ freedom sit alongside very focused local history \u2013 according to the show, around 10 to 15 per cent of Brighton\u2019s population identify as lesbian, gay, bisexual, trans and queer.\n\nQueer Looks brings together about 20 outfits given to the museum by LGBTQ individuals who live or have lived in the Brighton area, alongside oral histories of their experiences. It is the second chapter of a project called Wear it Out, a collaboration with Brighton\u2019s museums and the London College of Fashion. \u201cIts timeframe is 1917 to 2017,\u201d says curator Martin Pel, yet the exhibition is open-ended, treating social history as living. \u201cThe museum\u2019s website has a micro-site where people can add new stories,\u201d Pel explains.\n\nAh, dear Brighton \u2013 piers, queers and racketeers \u2013 No\u00ebl Coward\n\n\u201cThe show marks the 50th anniversary of the partial decriminalisation of homosexuality in 1967 [in England and Wales],\u201d he continues. \u201cBrighton Museum is the perfect venue for it: people have gravitated to Brighton as it\u2019s tolerant.\u201d In fact, the gay community already had a strong presence there in the early 20th Century, if playwright and composer No\u00ebl Coward\u2019s quip is to be believed: \u201cAh, dear Brighton \u2013 piers, queers and racketeers.\u201d\n\nThe first part of Wear it Out comprised an exhibition about defiantly androgynous, openly lesbian artist Hannah Gluckstein (1895-1978). While her art was arguably academic and stiff in style, its subject matter was challenging. In a self-portrait of 1925, as if pre-figuring the look of such Spanish Civil War communist sympathisers as Stephen Spender, she sported a rakishly angled beret and tie, a cigarette drooping from her mouth. Decades later, sexually ambiguous model and disco diva Grace Jones echoed this pose \u2013 cigarette dangling from her lips \u2013 on the cover of her 1981 album, Nightclubbing.\n\nGluckstein also adopted the clipped name Gluck \u2013 without \u201cprefixes, suffixes and quotes\u201d \u2013 thereby demonstrating her impatience for glib gender stereotyping. And she had relationships with florist Constance Spry and journalist Edith Shackleton Heald, with whom she lived for 30 years in Steyning, near Brighton. She donated a number of her girlfriends\u2019 dresses to the museum.\n\nQueer Looks argues that clothing has played \u2013 and still plays \u2013 a key role in shaping personal identities beyond conventional gender roles as well as, more collectively, those of subcultures who often adopt specific styles of clothing as an expression of solidarity. The growing number of officially acknowledged LGBTQ identities, from trans and non-binary to QTIPOC (queer, trans and intersex people of colour), has given rise to a much bigger variety of sartorial styles.\n\nThe exhibition comprises vignettes that dovetail outfits, portraits of their owners and biographical snippets. It also touches upon 18th-Century LGBTQ-related language and its etymology, for example, the word homosexuality, said to have been coined in 1869 by Austrian-born human-rights campaigner Karl-Maria Kertbeny.\n\nRadical chic\n\nSome individuals participating in the show have been instrumental in steering fashion in a radically new direction. James Gardiner was part of the first influx of London College of Fashion students in the early 1960s, and dressed movie star Elizabeth Taylor for her 40th birthday. In order to help finance his college days, he sold ties to Vince\u2019s Man\u2019s Shop in London\u2019s Soho, a store that helped to revolutionise menswear in the 1960s.\u201cHis outfit is a suit worn with brothel creepers,\u201d says Pel. \u201cShop-owner Vince stocked tight-fitting, Italian men\u2019s threads \u2013 including shorter jackets called bum freezers \u2013 that appealed to gay men who wanted to show off their bodies, and inspired the broader Mod look.\u201d\n\nDavid Raven, aka drag artist Maisie Trollette, is represented by a paisley jacket, Cartier shirt and cotton trousers from 1985. He first began performing in the 1960s while working as a grocer at Selfridges in London (he is now based in Brighton) but kept his alter ego under wraps: \u201cI was recognised once by a man who said to me \u2018Didn\u2019t I see you doing cabaret last night?\u2019 I told him he must be mistaken because I was a grocer.\u201d\n\nBy contrast, for many gay men from the 1970s to the present day, clothing has taken the form of overtly sexual fetish gear, such as the chaps, shorts or harnesses worn by Michael James, born in 1941, and Jason Snelling (born in 1970) at gay clubs with strict leather-queen or \u2018clone\u2019 dress codes.\n\n\u201cOne thing that\u2019s come out of Queer Looks is that lesbians in the 1960s cherished their clothes less \u2013 avoiding fashion was political for them,\u201d says Pel. \u201cThey wanted to be valued for what was in their heads, not for their appearance.\u201d\n\nMy style rises above the stereotypes of being feminine, of being a woman \u2013 Ellie Medhurst\n\nBy contrast, for Ellie Medhurst, a lesbian in her early 20s, dressing flamboyantly is integral to her identity. She is never seen in anything but pink and claims that, by knowingly embracing this extreme, she is transcending the cliche that pink is oppressively \u2018feminine\u2019 and retrograde. \u201cMy style rises above the stereotypes of being feminine, of being a woman,\u201d she says.\n\nCandice Armah \u2013 26, black, and non-binary (not defined by traditional polarised categories of male and female or gay and heterosexual) \u2013 often wears a T-shirt with the slogan \u2018Black History is World History\u2019 by Brighton label Sassy Tees, which dedicates itself to \u201canti-racist organising and Pan-Africanist networking.\u201d\n\nFilm-maker and activist Fox Fisher, also non-binary and founder of Brighton\u2019s Trans Pride, declares allegiances in a T-shirt emblazoned with \u2018Trans Pride\u2019 teamed with rugged utility clothing that hints at militancy, including \u201cwell-worn\u201d boots like those of a \u201cfoot soldier, fighting for trans rights\u201d.\n\nAn Nguyen \u2013 a gender-fluid, Vietnamese man, born in 1995, who later moved from Singapore, where he was at school and where same-sex is illegal, to Brighton \u2013 says, \u201cI stayed low-key in Singapore\u201d. Brighton was the \u201cfirst safe place\u201d he has lived in. His choice of eveningwear there? An Olivier Theyskens coat worn as a dress, ballet shoes and jewellery.\n\nIf you would like to comment on this story or anything else you have seen on BBC Culture, head over to our Facebook page or message us on Twitter.\n\nAnd if you liked this story, sign up for the weekly bbc.com features newsletter, called \u201cIf You Only Read 6 Things This Week\u201d.

Previously it only put out growth data every three months.\n\nIn the three months to May, the economy grew by 0.2% compared with the previous three-month period.\n\n\"The first of our new rolling estimates of GDP shows a mixed picture of the UK economy with modest growth driven by the services sector, partly offset by falling construction and industrial output,\" said the ONS's head of national accounts, Rob Kent-Smith.\n\n\"Retailing, computer programming and legal services all performed strongly in the three months to May, while housebuilding and manufacturing both contracted.\n\n\"Services, in particular, grew robustly in May, with retailers enjoying a double boost from the warm weather and the royal wedding. Construction also saw a return to growth after a weak couple of months.\"\n\nIan Stewart, chief economist at Deloitte, said: \"The long awaited bounce-back from a weak first quarter has failed to materialise, with the rolling three-month growth rate unchanged into May.\n\nHe added: \"The fact that first-half growth is set to be below trend hardly makes a compelling case for an August rate rise.\"\n\nHowever, Samuel Tombs, chief UK economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, said the upturn in May was \"just strong enough to tip the balance\" in favour of an August rate rise, \"provided the government doesn't implode before then\".\n\nAnalysis:\n\nKamal Ahmed, BBC economics editor\n\nGetting a little better, pretty slowly. Today's economic growth figures for May reveal that the \"bounce-back\" from the weather-related misery of the first three months of the year is small, though not insignificant.\n\nThe services sector - which accounts for 80% of our economy - is stronger. Construction activity was also up by 2.9% compared with the previous month - although we must always take care with monthly figures, which can tend to be volatile.\n\nThis morning's retail sales figures from the British Retail Consortium also revealed a pick-up. We are all doing a bit more shopping.\n\nThe royal wedding and sunny weather are doing their bit now, in the way the snow and frost depressed February and March.\n\nThere is little in today's figures that will surprise the Bank of England, which is contemplating increasing interest rates next month. It predicted a \"bounce-back\" earlier in the year.\n\nAnd against a subdued background, there is evidence today that is happening.\n\nOther figures also released by the ONS showed:\n\nThe country's total trade deficit widened by \u00a35bn to \u00a38.3bn in the three months to May, mainly because of falling goods exports and rising goods imports\n\nServices output increased by 0.4% in the three months to May compared with the previous three months\n\nConstruction output fell by 1.7% in the three months to May, but rose 2.9% in May compared with April\n\nProduction fell by 0.6% in the three months to May compared with the previous three months, because of a fall of 1.2% in manufacturing.\n\nWhy have the UK's GDP statistics changed?\n\nBasically, in an effort to make them more reliable.\n\nUntil now, the ONS used to release a preliminary estimate of GDP four times a year.\n\nBut this early quarterly estimate was based on about 40% of the information necessary to produce a full estimate of GDP, so it was subject to change as more data came in.\n\nThe new policy should mean that the figures do not need to be revised as much in subsequent months.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images\n\nHow have the statisticians managed to do this?\n\nThe ONS's new monthly and rolling three-monthly estimates will be compiled with what it calls \"a significantly higher data content\".\n\nThe office says it has spent money on upgrading its systems so that it can gather and analyse information in a more timely fashion.\n\nIn particular, the service sector, which contributes 80% of the UK's GDP, will now be measured more speedily than before, it says.\n\nWhat are the advantages and disadvantages of the change?\n\nIt will bring the UK more into line with other developed economies, which tend to produce more accurate initial quarterly estimates that don't need such big revisions.\n\nIn fact, the ONS intends to leapfrog other countries, by making the UK the first big economy to produce a monthly figure.\n\nHowever, in the short term, it could be bad news for one of the ONS's biggest customers, the Bank of England.\n\nThe Bank's interest rate-setting Monetary Policy Committee is due to meet on 2 August, amid speculation that it could raise rates by a quarter of a percentage point to 0.75%.\n\nUnder the old timetable for release of GDP figures, MPC members would have been armed with a preliminary estimate of second-quarter growth. But now those figures will not be available until 10 August.\n\nThe ONS says those figures will be more comprehensive and accurate because of the delay.

After a career in law and then business, since 2013 she has been the boss of UK private healthcare provider Simplyhealth.\n\nAs the UK's National Health Service continues to celebrate its 70th birthday, Ms Abdin - the daughter of an NHS doctor - says there will always also be a place for the private sector in healthcare provision.\n\nImage copyright Willl Walker / North News Image caption Mo Farah winning last year's Great North Run, which Simplyhealth sponsors\n\nBorn in India, Ms Abdin and her family moved to the UK when she was five.\n\nIn addition to coping with her mobility issues, when she was 13 her mother died aged just 34, leaving her father to bring up her and her two sisters.\n\nAlthough Ms Abdin says she \"toyed\" with the idea of joining the medical profession during her teens, she decided to go into law instead.\n\nSo after university in Wales, she became a barrister in 1988, specialising in corporate law and intellectual property.\n\nIn 1991 she joined the legal department of the Bradford & Bingley building society, but the busy lifestyle didn't suit family life.\n\n\"I had two small children, and there was a moment when I was up and down motorways and hearing my daughter read over the mobile phone and I thought: 'There's more to life than this'.\n\n\"I wanted something different.\"\n\nImage copyright Simplyhealth Image caption Romana Abdin now has to return the company to profitability\n\nSo in 2001 she joined the board of Simplyhealth, which is based in Andover, Hampshire, in the south of England.\n\nShe says that she \"fell in love with the organisation and its purpose\".\n\nAfter 12 years Ms Abdin was asked if she'd like to become chief executive, but she didn't immediately say yes.\n\n\"I was almost going 'I'm not sure I'm the right person, why should anyone follow me?'.\n\n\"I was asking: 'Do I have the skills to go with this role?', which is typically what women do.\"\n\nThankfully for her she eventually took up the position.\n\nImage copyright Simplyhealth Image caption The company's modern headquarters is in Hampshire\n\nSimplyhealth today has 3.4 million active users who pay a monthly fee to help cover costs such as private health checks, dental treatment, eye surgery, physiotherapy, and hospital stays.\n\nBut with the NHS proudly celebrating seven decades of free-at-the-point-of-delivery universal healthcare, why should people pay to go private?\n\n\"I think the idea of universal healthcare is amazing, but the idea was never intended to be comprehensive,\" says Ms Abdin.\n\nThat's a quote that the NHS's founder Aneurin Bevan would likely strongly object to, but Ms Abdin says that people need to take some personal \"responsibility\".\n\nShe adds: \"I believe if the NHS is to continue servicing people in acute moments, every single one of us needs to take responsibility, and organisations [like Simplyhealth] are best placed [to help].\"\n\nMore The Boss features, which every week profile a different business leader from around the world:\n\nIn terms of Simplyheath's financial performance, Ms Abdin has to turn things around after a difficult 2017.\n\nLast year its turnover fell 4% to \u00a3238m. More pressingly, annual losses widened from \u00a3800,000 to \u00a34.4m.\n\nMs Abdin says that this loss was the result of costs associated with the closure of subsidiary retail business The Unlimited Company, which sold a range of mobility and home assistance products - from mobility scooters to wheelchairs, and kitchens and bathrooms designed for disabled people.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption With the NHS providing free-at-the-point-of-delivery care, how do you persuade people to pay for private healthcare?\n\nThe Unlimited Company had struggled because such products were being increasingly sold by general retailers.\n\nMs Abdin says that excluding the cost of closing these stores Simplyhealth was profitable. Its corporate clients include retailers Asda and John Lewis.\n\nPatricia Davies, a health insurance expert at research group Global Data, says that challenge for private healthcare providers in the UK would always remain the same - how to persuade businesses and members of the public to buy cover \"when we have the NHS\".\n\nAsked how her colleagues would describe her, Ms Abdin responds: \"Challenging, disruptive, energetic and loud.\n\n\"I'm loud - leadership is about energy. I think the other thing is to say I'm passionate about developing people. I love to see people grow.\"\n\nIn terms of her own health, Ms Abdin says that walking gets harder as she gets older.\n\n\"Steps become a problem, and walking is difficult, but it has never stopped me doing anything I wanted,\" she says.\n\nShe adds that once a month she visits a charity \"which is focused on helping people with mobility problems remain active\".\n\n\"I use machinery that works with you and assists you to move, for example a rowing machine that you press against.

But this working, not state, visit is expected to be different to those that have gone before.\n\nIn 1977 Jimmy Carter came to Britain on his first overseas trip as president. His main aim was to attend the G7 summit in London, but he also chose to visit Newcastle.\n\nThe city had taken part in a scheme designed to build bridges between the United States and the rest of the world. So the newly elected leader of the free world decided to conduct his first act of global diplomacy from a podium outside the concrete splendour of Newcastle Civic Centre.\n\nHe was given the freedom of the city by the mayor. And when the peanut farmer from Georgia stepped up to the microphone, he greeted an adoring crowd of 20,000 people thus: \"Howay the lads! I am grateful to be a Geordie now.\"\n\nThe local newspaper, the Chronicle, reported: \"They packed the airport. They packed the streets. They packed the area outside the Civic Centre and they opened their arms to him. And he loved it. A great smile spread across his face... as he was greeted by crowds waving both the Union Jack and the Stars and Stripes.\"\n\nThis was how it used to be: British crowds cheering US presidents.\n\nImage copyright PA Image caption President Carter was made an honorary freeman of the city of Newcastle in 1977\n\nWhen JFK came in 1961, half a million people lined the route between London airport and the west end to catch a glimpse of him and his wife Jackie Kennedy. The scale of the public adulation was in part due to the fact that US presidents enjoyed great popularity in Britain: they were political show business and our closest allies in recent wars.\n\nThey also came to the UK more rarely. The first president to visit was Woodrow Wilson in 1918 during the post-World War One peace talks. But it was not for another 27 years - and after another world war - that a second US president came to our shores, in 1945.\n\nAnd all Harry S Truman did was visit King George VI on a naval cruiser anchored in Plymouth harbour. Dwight D Eisenhower did not come until 1959. So, only three presidential visits in 40 years. Lyndon Johnson never came, nor did Gerald Ford.\n\nUS presidents also enjoyed a warm relationship with the Royal Family. Eisenhower was a particular favourite of the Queen, who invited him to stay at Balmoral - the only president to do so.\n\nLike Donald Trump, \"Ike\" also owned property in Scotland: not a golf course but an apartment at Culzean Castle on the Ayrshire coast which had been given to him by the owners, in recognition of his role as supreme allied commander during World War Two.\n\nRonald Reagan also got on well with the Queen, who in 1982 personally invited him to stay at Windsor Castle and go for a ride in the Great Park. In 1994, Bill and Hillary Clinton were honoured with a sleepover on board the royal yacht Britannia in Portsmouth.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption Huge crowds flocked to see President Kennedy during his 1961 visit\n\nIn 2003 George Bush spent the night at Buckingham Palace - the first president to do so since Wilson in 1918. In contrast, Donald Trump is expected to get a cup of tea when he passes through Windsor on Friday.\n\nNor may President Trump receive quite the same political welcome as his predecessors. He will not attend cabinet as Bill Clinton did in 1997 shortly after Tony Blair was first elected prime minister. He will not get to flip burgers in the Downing Street garden or address both houses of parliament, as President Obama did in 2011.\n\nInstead, he will make do with a short visit to the prime minister's country residence, Chequers, like Richard Nixon in 1970. This will be very much a working visit. A full state visit may have been offered but there is no date in the diary for when it may happen.\n\nOf course, presidential visits do not always go smoothly. There was a private diplomatic row in 1982 when the White House delayed replying to the Queen's invitation to Ronald Reagan to stay at Windsor because his wife Nancy's astrologer was worried about overseas travel.\n\nIn 1997 I watched as Bill Clinton's long motorcade was divided in two when London's Tower Bridge was opened to allow through a Thames sailing barge - much to the consternation of the security men.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption Barack Obama took part in a memorable barbecue in the No 10 garden in 2011\n\nAnd in 1977, after a banquet at Buckingham Palace, President Carter decided to bid farewell to the Queen Mother by kissing her full on the lips, something that apparently had not happened since King George VI died in 1952. \"I took a sharp step backwards,\" she recalled later. \"Not quite far enough.\"\n\nSo huge efforts will be made to ensure that President Trump's trip goes smoothly. Many demonstrations have been planned, but the huge security operation surrounding his progress from London to Chequers to Windsor to Scotland - largely by air - means that he may not get too close to the protests.\n\nMuch harder to cover up will be the fundamental policy differences between the US and British governments.\n\nSince Donald Trump took office, Theresa May has publicly disagreed with him over his decision to impose trade tariffs, abandon the Iran nuclear deal, move the US embassy to Jerusalem, order a Muslim travel ban and retweet anti-Muslim messages from a British far-right group.\n\nBritish ministers and officials will do their best to welcome Mr Trump but even they are now talking about the need to respect the office of the presidency rather than the current incumbent as an individual.

For that same amount, however, Mr Pruitt landed a room for six months last year in a furnished townhouse just a few blocks from the US Capitol.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption Scott Pruitt rented a room in this Capitol Hill townhouse for $50 a night\n\nHe only paid for nights he stayed there, and his daughter - who was working as a White House intern - had her own room (with no indication of what, if anything, she paid).\n\nThe house is owned by the wife of an energy industry lobbyist, and while Mr Pruitt has insisted that there was no potential conflict of interest, that does not appear to be the case.\n\nMr Pruitt points to an EPA ethics review that approved his lease, but several agency employees involved have since said they were not given all the relevant information.\n\nHot water temperature: Boiling. Accepting below-market-rate housing from a deep-pocketed Washington lobbyist with business before your agency? It doesn't get much swampier than that.\n\nSirens to clear the traffic\n\nEarly in Mr Pruitt's tenure as EPA chief, he reportedly requested that his motorcade use flashing lights and police sirens to speed trips through Washington-area traffic when he was late for official meetings or rushing to the airport for a flight.\n\nIn at least one instance, according to the New York Times, he used it to speed to dinner at a trendy French restaurant.\n\nPer multiple media accounts, the head of Mr Pruitt's protective detail - a 16-year-veteran of the EPA - objected to the use of the sirens and was subsequently reassigned within the agency.\n\nAgency officials have denied that Mr Pruitt requested the sirens or that their use deviated from government guidelines.\n\nWater temperature: Simmering. In the vast scheme of things this is a relatively minor issue, but demanding traffic-halting motorcades to chic French bistros is the kind of tidbit that can capture the public's attention.\n\nThe travel budget\n\nIn his first year as EPA administrator, Mr Pruitt spent more than $168,000 on air travel across the US, including frequent trips to his home state of Oklahoma and several international journeys. He often relied on charter jet service or first-class commercial airline seats because, per the agency, security concerns prevented him from mingling with the masses in coach.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption The EPA spent more than $90,000 on Scott Pruitt's travel in June 2017, which included a trip to Italy for an environmental summit\n\nMr Pruitt spent $36,000 for a military flight from Cincinnati to New York so he could catch a first-class flight to Italy, where he met with foreign leaders and took a private tour of the Vatican.\n\nAn EPA spokesperson told the Washington Post that Mr Pruitt's travels have all been approved by the agency and were needed to spread the administration's message and hear \"directly from people affected by EPA's regulatory overreach\".\n\nFox News' Lukas Mikelionis notes that previous EPA administrators have spent similar figures on their foreign trips, when factoring in higher costs for Mr Pruitt's round-the-clock security.\n\nWater temperature: Toasty. Extensive use of first-class and charter travel was enough to force Health and Human Services Secretary Tom Price out of his job last year, but travel-scandal fatigue may be setting in. Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke has faced similar allegations and seems secure in his job.\n\nQuestionable purchases\n\nThen there are some rather unusual purchases the EPA has made under Mr Pruitt's tenure. His office spent $5,800 on thumb-print security locks, $1560 for 12 fountain pens and $43,000 for a soundproof phone booth. There was a proposal for $70,000 to replace two desks in his office suite, including one that was bulletproof. In the end, however, the EPA ended up spending $2,000 to refurbish an antique oversize desk for Mr Pruitt that was being stored in a government warehouse.\n\nWater temperature: Tepid. Nothing is going to top Housing and Urban Development Secretary Ben Carson's since cancelled purchase of a $30,000 dining set for his office, although bulletproof desks and soundproof communications stations do reveal a bit of an obsession with security.\n\nMisuse of staffers\n\nLast year Mr Pruitt reportedly instructed an aide to contact Republican donors and businesses in an effort to find six-figure employment for his wife, Marlyn. In one notable instance detailed by the Washington Post, the EPA chief had his scheduler reach out to the head of the fast-food company Chick-fil-A to explore the possibility of having his wife operate one of their franchises.\n\nMrs Pruitt, a former school nurse in Oklahoma, performed consulting work for several clients with Republican ties - involvements that could violate ethics rules prohibiting government officials from using their positions for personal financial gain.\n\nJobs weren't the only thing Mr Pruitt had staffers hunting for, either. According to congressional testimony, the EPA head instructed his aides to find a new apartment for him, call the Trump hotel to inquire about purchasing a used mattress, buy him fancy snack food, arrange a family vacation to California, pick up his dry cleaning and search for a particular brand of moisturising lotion available only in select Ritz-Carlton hotels.\n\nOn multiple occasions staffers reportedly had to use their own credit cards to make purchases for Mr Pruitt and, according to The Washington Post, one staffer was never reimbursed for some of her expenses.\n\nWater temperature: Simmering. Assigning government staffers to conduct personal business during work hours or to provide uncompensated help is a big ethical no-no. If any of the organisations approached for help with Ms Pruitt's job search had business before the EPA, that would be a particularly egregious violation.\n\nReassigned staffers\n\nMr Pruitt's first security head wasn't the only senior EPA officials moved to different duties once the new administrator arrived.\n\nPer the New York Times, at least five officials - including one veteran of the Trump presidential campaign - were \"reassigned or demoted\" or otherwise moved after they questioned the agency's \"spending and management\" under Mr Pruitt.\n\nIt shouldn't come as much of a surprise that career EPA employees have been uncomfortable under the direction of a man who had railed against the agency - and filed lawsuits challenging its actions - prior to taking the helm.\n\nWater temperature: Luke-warm. Personality clashes are inevitable, and it's difficult to determine whether these moves are because of legitimate policy differences or retribution for attempts to prevent wasteful spending and abuse of power.\n\nRewarded staffers\n\nTwo political appointees who followed Mr Pruitt to the EPA from Oklahoma were given sizeable pay boosts, apparently over the objection of the White House.\n\nThe EPA used a provision of a clean-drinking-water law to supplement the salaries of the aides - to the tune of $57,000 in one case and $28,000 in another - after the White House had rejected a direct request for a salary increase.\n\nAccording to The Atlantic magazine, the move angered long-time EPA staffers, who viewed it as a misuse of money allocated by law for hiring scientific and engineering professionals\n\nIn a testy interview with Fox News, Mr Pruitt said he only recently learned of the pay boosts for his two close aides and have ordered that they be rescinded. The Washington Post, however, cites EPA officials on background saying the administrator authorised the moves himself.\n\nWater temperature: Steaming. This one probably won't make much of a dent in public opinion, but the folks in the White House certainly won't be happy about Mr Pruitt flouting their directives.\n\nHis ambition\n\nMr Pruitt has reportedly been angling for a chance to rise above his current EPA station, potentially seeking to be the next US attorney general if Jeff Sessions, who has fallen into disfavour with the president, were to get the axe.\n\nThe rumours were growing thick enough that the president felt compelled to debunk them himself in a Friday morning tweet.\n\nThe former Oklahoma attorney general may also have an eye toward his home state, which could explain his frequent visits. There's a governor's election there this November, and the former attorney general would rocket to the front of the pack if he threw his hat in the ring.\n\nWater temperature: Cool. Aspirations for higher office are hardly scandalous in Washington, although furtively lobbying for jobs that are currently filled - even when the current occupant is the oft-beleaguered Sessions - is a bit unseemly.\n\nWhy Pruitt resigned and what happens next?\n\nOn Thursday morning CNN quoted an unnamed senior White House official saying that the Pruitt controversies were \"inching toward the tipping point\". It turns out that point was very close indeed.\n\nThe EPA chief had managed to hold out longer than most expected as a cavalcade of controversies mounted, each alone enough to fell a Cabinet appointee in a past administration.\n\nMr Pruitt had survived due to a combination of the vigour with which he advanced the conservative goal of paring regulations and weakening the agency and Mr Trump's natural reluctance to cede to a political outcry.\n\nIn the end, however, it was Mr Pruitt who had been weakened beyond repair - hobbled by allegations of abuse of the power and privileges of office. Mr Trump had come to Washington pledging to \"drain the swamp\", and Democrats - with mid-term elections looming - were poised to point to Mr Pruitt as a prime example of how the swamp had consumed the president and Republicans in general.\n\nWith Andrew Wheeler - a former coal industry lobbyist - set to run the agency for the immediate future, little will probably change as far as policies and priorities within the EPA. Many Republicans in Washington, who were growing uneasy with Mr Pruitt's seemingly never-ending bad press, will surely be happy with the change.\n\nTheir relief, however, may be tinged with a certain amount of regret. Mr Pruitt had proven to be an effective champion of the conservative fight against the EPA - and even environmentalists had recognised him as a formidable adversary.\n\nMr Pruitt himself had aspirations for higher office - either within the administration or back home in Oklahoma.

David Davis' move, while not completely surprising, throws doubt on to how secure the government's Brexit strategy is.\n\nSome of Theresa May's colleagues had urged her to face down her Brexiteer ministers but Number 10 had hoped to keep them all on side, and a carefully designed strategy to move them to her position brokered an agreement in cabinet at the end of their day-long meeting at Chequers on Friday .\n\nImage copyright Crown Copyright Image caption Theresa May secured her cabinet's support at a meeting at Chequers on Friday\n\nBut Mr Davis, who was meant to be responsible for Brexit policy, felt, according to colleagues, that he was \"wondering if he really had a proper job\" after Number 10 chose to follow a very different path to the now former Brexit secretary's intention.\n\nMr Davis has been frustrated for some time after the most senior official at the Department for Exiting the EU - Olly Robbins - was moved into Number 10 to work directly for Theresa May.\n\nTo some former Remainers, Mr Davis' departure could even be considered a temporary relief. One of his fellow ministers remarked, \"it's just a personal outburst\", adding: \"He is not exactly the cleverest, he has always struggled to muscle into any of the complicated arguments.\"\n\nBut conditions in the Tory party are febrile. Theresa May had carefully constructed her cabinet with a balance of Brexiteers and former Remainers. With no majority, and unhappiness on the back benches, it adds instability at a time when the prime minister was pursuing calm.\n\nAnd when she was hoping to project an image to Brussels of authority and stability, it is a headache she could well do without. He could provide a rallying point from outside government for those forces in the Tory party who believe the Brexit plan the prime minister is pursuing is not the Brexit that a clear but narrow majority of the public chose.\n\nImage caption Michael Gove was tipped as a replacement for David Davis\n\nWestminster being Westminster, eyes will immediately turn to who will replace him.

I have not felt ready until now to acknowledge explicitly that we had met, but do now that the book is nearing completion.\n\nAs a man, Sergei is proud of his achievements, both before and after joining his country's intelligence service.\n\nHe has a deadpan wit and is remarkably stoical given the reverses he's suffered in his life; from his imprisonment following conviction in 2006 on charges of spying for Britain, to the loss of his wife Liudmila to cancer in 2012, and the untimely death of his son Alexander (or Sasha) last summer.\n\nImage copyright Reuters Image caption Sergei Skripal is pictured here in a court in Moscow in 2006\n\nHis domestic routine appeared settled and quiet, with regular visits to the cemetery, favourite shops, and lately the Railway Social Club.\n\nCertainly he did not seem to feel himself under great threat.\n\nSergei's Salisbury life might be best described as semi-retired, since he was making occasional trips to lecture or advise friendly intelligence services. But this appeared to be a standard arrangement with defectors, the former KGB man Oleg Gordievsky similarly giving talks to MI6 training courses and foreign agencies.\n\nOne theory that investigators are probing is that Russia's spies might have regarded Skripal's activities of this kind as evidence he had re-entered the espionage world.\n\nBoth he and his daughter must now make difficult decisions about their future.\n\nYulia has spoken about her hopes of returning to Russia \"one day\". Her visit in March was only supposed to last a fortnight but now it is unclear what will become of her. Certainly, she is committed for the time being to helping in her father's recovery.\n\nFor Sergei the equation is different. He was not expecting to go back to Russia, and now he knows he will not be returning to his home in this country either. His house in Salisbury has been bought by the government both as a crime scene and a place still in need of extensive decontamination.\n\nWill he make a new life under an assumed identity in the US or a Commonwealth country?\n\nThat promises to be an extremely difficult decision.\n\nCertainly in US witness protection schemes, people are often asked to cut themselves adrift completely from their past. Having seen the peaceful life that he was enjoying in Salisbury last summer, I would imagine that will be very hard for Sergei.\n\nFrom the UK government point of view there is both an acknowledgement that Sergei and Yulia will be free to make their own choices and but also a hope that these will not trigger further political rows with Russia.\n\nThe saga of Alexander Litvinenko, killed by polonium poisoning in 2006, shows though that those in government who want to move on from the Skripal affair may not have things all their own way.\n\nIn the Litvinenko case, a police arrest warrant for the suspected poisoner, seven months after the deed, reignited the row. Should the police name suspects for Salisbury in the coming months, either in the poisoning or the surveillance of the Skripals that preceded it, then the issue will return to the world's front pages.\n\nWatch Newsnight weekdays 22:30 BBC Two and afterwards on iPlayer.", "authors": ["Mark Urban", "Diplomatic", "Defence Editor"], "url": "https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-44717835"}, {"title": "In Milpa Alta, people still speak the Aztec language", "text": "In the 1970s, before workers laid the asphalt that became a two-lane highway connecting Mexico City with Milpa Alta, the southernmost of the city\u2019s 16 delegations, Javier Galicia-Silva\u2019s grandmother would hike down the hills to Xochimilco each day at 04:00. From here she would take a chalupa (a large water taxi) along the ancient canals that lead towards downtown, where she\u2019d spend the day selling fresh produce in the La Merced district near the grand Z\u00f3calo (historic centre). With a bit of money and some supplies loaded on her back, she\u2019d return to the village around 20:00 in time to sleep and do the six-hour round trip all over again the next day.\n\nAlthough farmers from Milpa Alta now make the trip by road, bringing nopal (an edible cactus), mole (a traditional Mexican sauce), honey and tortillas fresh from their homes and gardens to sell in markets and on street corners across the city, not much else has changed.\n\nYou may also be interested in:\n\n\u2022 A linguistic enigma at world\u2019s end\n\n\u2022 A language only three women can speak\n\n\u2022 An ancient word no-one can translate\n\nMilpa Alta (\u2018high cornfield\u2019 in Spanish) couldn\u2019t be more different from the smog-laden city to which it formally belongs and that it overlooks from its mountainside location. What used to be known as distant farmland and Nahua villages has slowly been ceded into the city. Although literally part of Mexico City, it's rarely visited by other Mexico City residents. Foreign tourists are even more unusual. And although it\u2019s officially within the city limits, the people of Milpa Alta in many ways live as they have done for hundreds of years.\n\nMilpa Alta couldn\u2019t be more different from the smog-laden city to which it formally belongs\n\nMany people here speak Nahuatl, the language of the Aztec empire, and they still use the pre-Columbian milpa system of crop rotation. The delegation is approximately 50% forest, and the fields are mostly pesticide free, watered by the rain and ploughed by horses. Insects and various heirloom corns (including blue and red varieties) are still very much part of the diet in this municipality that produces a huge quantity of food for the city, just as it did for the inhabitants of Tenochtitl\u00e1n (the ancient city of the Aztecs, now known as central Mexico City) more than 500 years ago. Of Mexico City\u2019s delegations, Milpa Alta is the greenest and least populated. It's a land of forests and fields, not of concrete shantytowns common among the city\u2019s sprawl.\n\nDespite the relatively new road, getting to Milpa Alta still requires an effort. The congestion of Xochimilco, its neighbouring delegation, makes for a long bus ride from either the train station in Xochimilco or from Tasque\u00f1a, the city\u2019s southernmost subway station and transportation hub. When I visited, it was two hours of stop-and-go along one-way roads. The traffic out of Mexico City slowly lightened, the road began to switchback and the air cleared. The bus slowly emptied and the mountains that are often invisible from within the central city suddenly loomed above me. It was clear that I was headed somewhere else, a place somehow distant. When the complex, sweet scent of mole began to waft into the bus, the driver announced the stop for San Pedro Atocpan: the first of the 12 pueblos in Milpa Alta, and a world away from the urbanity of Mexico City.\n\nMornings are chilly in Milpa Alta, and Galicia-Silva, a Mesoamerican historian and professor, was wearing a red sweater and black beret when he opened the door to me and the silent street. He had just finished giving a free Nahuatl class to community members, which he hopes will help maintain the language of his ancestors. He spoke fast Spanish, smiled often and moved slowly, inviting me into his garden. When he talked of his grandparents and his hometown of Santa Ana Tlacotenco in Milpa Alta, it was with pride.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t feel like I\u2019m part of the city,\u201d he said as we ate fresh starfruit, guava and grapes from his land, moving our plastic chairs around to escape the gruelling summer sun. \u201cThe city begins in Xochimilco and goes northward. I am from Milpa Alta. If I come across someone else from Milpa Alta while I\u2019m in the city, we ask each other when we\u2019re going back home. There is a brotherhood here.\u201d\n\nMilpa Alta, with its ancient language and customs, has been self-sufficient for millennia. The forests are home to deer, rabbits and even hallucinogenic mushrooms that Galicia-Silva says can make you \u201cgo crazy\u201d if not cooked properly. Many of Milpa Alta\u2019s inhabitants are in the business of making mole, and the region produces 90% of the mole consumed in Mexico City.\n\nMesoamerican traditions are still in practice, such as shaman-led temascals (an indigenous sweat bath held in an adobe hut, purported to have curative and spiritual properties), and locals boast that there are festivities in the delegation 365 days a year, including a summer festival in each of its 12 pueblos (villages). Most of these involve traditional dances, religious pilgrimages and mayordom\u00edas, the guarding of a religious icon in one\u2019s house and hosting a feast for the community.\n\nDay of the Dead (1-2 November), a syncretised holiday blending both indigenous and Catholic traditions, is celebrated differently here from other parts of Mexico: villagers go to the cemetery on 29 September to formally invite the deceased to the homes of the living to feast, starting on 31 October. Without the invitation, they say the spirits won\u2019t join their families. When the holiday arrives, bonfires are set outside each home, around which the entire family gathers to eat tamales (a pre-Hispanic dish, made with corn masa and usually meat, then steamed in a corn husk).\n\nAs you walk the snaking, steep streets of the villages, you\u2019ll likely be invited in for a chat, some tangy pulque (fermented agave nectar), or a fresh tlacoyo (a corn masa tortilla filled with cheese, beans or meat and topped with nopal, cheese and salsa). The people here depend on each other, and everyone knows everyone\u2019s name. You\u2019ll hear Nahuatl words often, though the language\u2019s future has been uncertain for years.\n\n\u201cMy grandmother was born in the 1920s and was monolingual in Nahuatl,\u201d Galicia-Silva said. \u201cHer mother told her that she needed to teach her children to speak Spanish, not Nahuatl. My father was the last generation that learned Nahuatl in school. Nowadays, it is no longer the language of communication.\n\nAccording to Galicia-Silva, groups of teachers and community members from Milpa Alta approached the city government in the 1980s, hoping to mandate teaching of Nahuatl in public schools. Officials responded that students should be learning Spanish as their native tongue, and English, French or German as a second language, to increase future job and education prospects. Throughout Mexico\u2019s colonised history, to speak an indigenous language has resulted in discrimination, still present to this day. Galicia-Silva remembers being asked at his university if he was an Indian. His father had always told him they were a family of farmers: the word \u2018Indian\u2019 never came up. Today he proudly identifies as indigenous; specifically, as Nahua.\n\nI feel like it\u2019s an obligation; to rescue my identity and belonging in this community\n\nAnd there are more stirrings of identity revival. Up the hill from Galicia-Silva\u2019s home is the house of artist Jos\u00e9 Ortiz Rivera, where he and Oswaldo Galicia Calder\u00f3n, both Nahuatl professors, are giving another free Saturday class in Nahuatl to family members and neighbours. Their hope is to keep the language alive among the younger generations.\n\n\u201cMy parents spoke Nahuatl and now they are gone,\u201d said Victor Ortiz, Jos\u00e9\u2019s younger brother and a Milpa Alta native currently studying Nahuatl. His brother had spent more time with their Nahuatl-speaking parents and grandparents, and now he wants to learn it, too. \u201cI feel like it\u2019s an obligation; to rescue my identity and belonging in this community,\u201d he told me.\n\nMeanwhile, the delegation\u2019s population is growing quickly with people from outside the Nahua community, something that concerns Galicia-Silva when it comes to maintaining Milpa Alta\u2019s green spaces and ways of life.\n\n\u201cWhether we like it or not, we are in a globalised world and that\u2019s not going to change,\u201d he said, adding that rejuvenating indigenous language and culture can help to dismantle five centuries of oppression and exploitation. \u201cThis means that we have to do deep studies of our language and our history. When we talk about a decolonisation of our thinking, we are still far from that, but we are on the way there.\u201d\n\nWhether we like it or not, we are in a globalised world and that\u2019s not going to change\n\nI left Milpa Alta with my belly filled and my heart warmed by the hospitality of strangers. As the bus clanked back to the city, I thought of the great strides Milpa Altans are making towards the reclaiming their identity; and how, despite being part of this bustling megalopolis, it still feels a world away.\n\nSecret Worlds is a series from BBC Travel that invites you to explore the various ways destinations offer a sense of surprise by heading off the beaten path or uncovering hidden spaces.\n\nJoin more than three million BBC Travel fans by liking us on Facebook, or follow us on Twitter and Instagram.\n\nIf you liked this story, sign up for the weekly bbc.com features newsletter called \"If You Only Read 6 Things This Week\".

In this three-part series, he is travelling way beyond his comfort zone and the world of complimentary breakfast buffets to some of the most unlikely places on earth for a holiday. Hosted by locals and fully immersed in the local culture, Romesh gets an eye-opening, and at times heart-stopping, insider's guide to countries that are big on natural beauty, character and charm.\n\nIn this first episode, Romesh gets an insider's guide to Haiti to find out if his preconceptions about the Caribbean island are right, or if there is more to the country than the sensational headlines he has seen on the news. Everything Romesh has ever heard about Haiti has been negative. They had a dictator who terrorised the island, a 2010 earthquake that crippled the country and then a devastating hurricane. That is all before President Trump called it something unmentionable. But are all the bad news reports fair? Does Haiti deserve its reputation? Haiti is in the middle of the Caribbean, surrounded by Cuba, Jamaica and the Dominican Republic. It should be a paradise, so why doesn't anyone go there?\n\nTo find out, Romesh Ranganathan, comedian and coward, is travelling across the Atlantic to spend a week in the country. This isn't his typical holiday destination - Romesh's idea of a perfect holiday is a week in Spain. He avoids 'culture' and he rarely leaves the comfort of the hotel swimming pool. In almost every conceivable way he is the wrong person to send, except one - he is honest. Landing in the Haitian capital Port au Prince, Romesh sets to work getting to grips with a country that - arguably more than any other - has suffered from a bad reputation. Guided by his host - Peabody award-winning journalist Jeremy Dupin - Rom throws himself into Haitian life.

Experts hear how this blood wasn't found until the third police search of the vehicle. Glyn has always maintained the blood was planted and that Linda's death was staged. Inside Justice blood experts review the original forensic evidence presented at trial to see if they agree with the conclusions that were made 15 years ago.

Some phenomena in the ocean can only be witnessed after dark.\n\n1. Bioluminescence makes the sea shimmer\n\nYou may have seen the pictures.\n\nIt\u2019s night-time in an impossibly exotic location. Waves are breaking on the beach. The water is sparkling with electric blue lights.\n\nThe internet loves an image of a magical-looking bioluminescent bay. You may also have seen travel bloggers bemoaning the real event as not quite living up the hype.\n\nEven if the latter is true, bioluminescence (in this case usually caused by planktonic organisms called dinoflagellates) is a pretty amazing natural phenomenon.\n\nDinoflagellates emit blue light when disturbed, which is why they can be seen sparkling over wave crests, around boats or when a hand or paddle runs through them.\n\nThese tiny creatures are the most common source of bioluminescence at the ocean\u2019s surface.\n\nSo-called bioluminescent bays such as in Puerto Rico and Jamaica are among the best-known places to witness the glow. However, the ephemeral phenomenon can be found throughout the ocean where there are dense gatherings of dinoflagellates.\n\nSometimes dinoflagellates\u2019 population increases rapidly causing blooms, which by day are coloured a less attractive red-brown, sometimes known as red tides. And some, but not all, of these red tides are poisonous.\n\nEven stranger and rarer than bioluminescent bays are \u201cmilky seas\u201d, where continually glowing water stretches for as far as the eye can see.\n\nMilky seas have only been seen a few hundred times since 1915, mainly concentrated around north-western Indian Ocean and near Java, Indonesia.\n\nThey are not caused by dinoflagellates, but are thought to be the result of \u201cbioluminescent bacteria that have accumulated in large numbers near the surface\u201d, explains to Dr Matt Davis, Assistant Professor of Biology, St. Cloud State University in the US, who specialises in bioluminescence.\n\nReports by sailors over the centuries have described milky seas as a nocturnal whitish glow like a field of snow, but scientists have had little chance to investigate the phenomenon first-hand.\n\nIn 2005, researchers analysing archived satellite images found that milky seas could be seen from space and that one satellite had captured images of a huge area of ocean that had displayed the strange glow for three consecutive nights a decade earlier.\n\n2. Animals glow in the dark\n\nBioluminescence, the emission of visible light by an organism as the result of a natural chemical reaction, is common among marine life such as fishes, squid and molluscs. In the deep sea most species are bioluminescent, where it is the main source of light.\n\nIn shallower waters, most bioluminescent fish display their lights at night.\n\n\u201cFlashlight fishes have a specialized pouch under their eye that they can rotate to expose the light emitted from these bacteria, and they use this glow at night to hunt for food and communicate,\u201d says Dr Matt Davis.\n\nPonyfish emit light from the bioluminescent bacteria housed in a pouch using transparent muscular shutters, to communicate, he explains.\n\nCamouflage, defence and predation are among the variety of reasons fishes are thought to emit light.\n\nFor example, bobtail squid have an ingenious way of using lights. These nocturnal animals have a mutually beneficial relationship with luminescing bacteria that live in a mantel cavity on its underside. At night the squid control the intensity of this light to match the moonlight, and can reduce their silhouette to camouflage themselves from predators.\n\n3. Moonlight triggers the planet\u2019s biggest orgy\n\nThere is nothing more romantic than a moonlit night, especially if you are a coral on the Great Barrier Reef off Australia.\n\nOne night a year in spring, the biggest orgy on earth is triggered by lunar light.\n\nOver 130 coral species simultaneously release their eggs and sperm into the water during a window of just 30-60 minutes.\n\nThis mass spawning event might be the most extraordinary example of synchronised behaviour in the natural world.\n\nWhen the gametes \u2013 eggs and sperm cells - are released they hover for a moment, forming a ghostly replica of the reef\u2019s shape, before dispersing into an underwater blizzard as the sperm fertilise the eggs.\n\nDr Oren Levy, a marine biologist and ecologist and Professor of Life Sciences at Bar-Ilan University, Israel, has studied this extraordinary event.\n\n\u201cThis is really fascinating phenomena\u2026we know this event is going to happen a few nights after November's full moon each year, three to five [days] post full moon,\u201d he says.\n\n\u201c[It is] always amazing, in particular I am so amazed how each of the coral species year after year spawn at the same hour of the night.\u201d\n\nHe adds: \u201dOnce it happens it is always so exciting to see how everything is becoming so live and synchronised. It is almost [a] spiritual event and you understand the power of nature in its best.\u201d\n\nMoonlight triggers the phenomenon by acting as a synchroniser or \u201calarm\u201d probably with other environmental signals such as sunset timings, water temperature and tides to cue the time of the gamete [egg and sperm cells] release, explains Dr Levy.\n\nHe adds that corals seem to possess photoreceptors that detect the phases of the moon, which helps with the \u201cfine tuning\u201d of the gamete release.\n\n4. Sharks and seals rely on celestial light\n\nFor some seals, moonlit nights spell danger.\n\nDuring winter months, the 60,000 cape fur seals on Sea Island in False Bay, South Africa run the gauntlet of being picked off by great white sharks patrolling the seas when they enter and exit the water.\n\nOne study in 2016 hypothesised seals swimming at night during a full moon are at more risk of being eaten by a shark since bright moonlight silhouetting them against the surface makes them an easy meal for predators lurking below.\n\nHowever, most shark attacks on seals happen just after sunrise. Researchers behind the study, which measured shark attacks at dawn, were surprised to find seals were much less likely to be predated at this time of day if there was a full moon.\n\nThe researchers theorised that lunar illumination combined with emerging sunlight may decrease the stealth ability of the sharks and that the advantage switched from sharks to seals as night turned to day.\n\nAnd seals may rely on another celestial feature to navigate - the stars.\n\nCaptive harbour seals (Phoca vitulina) are able to locate a single lodestar and steer by it, researchers have shown.\n\nDuring a test using a simulated night sky, seals swam towards the brightest star and could orientate themselves when the stars were swivelled around.\n\nIn the wild, seals need to navigate the open ocean to find foraging grounds that may be separated by hundreds of kilometres.\n\nResearcher Dr Bjorn Mauck said at the time: \"Seals might learn the position of the stars relative to foraging grounds during dawn and dusk when they can see both the stars and landmarks at the coast.\"\n\n5. Strange animals come to the surface every night\n\nUnder the cover of darkness rarely seen creatures migrate to the ocean\u2019s surface to feed.\n\nThe Humboldt squid, also known as the jumbo squid, is one of the most eye-catching marine animals you can see lurking in surface waters.\n\nBy day the squid lurk in the deep waters of the Eastern Pacific Ocean along the deep shelf that runs off the west coast of the Americas and every night they are one of the many ocean animals to migrate upwards to find dinner.\n\nVertical (or diel) migration - when ocean animals swim to the surface at dusk and disappear down again at dawn \u2013 is extremely common.\n\n\u201cWhat [Humbioldt squid are] doing largely is following their main food item, which is the so-called lantern fish,\u201d explains Professor Paul Rodhouse, an Emeritus Fellow for the British Antarctic Survey (BAS) and former head of the organisation\u2019s biological sciences division.\n\nIn turn, lantern fish follow vertically migrating zooplankton.\n\nSince zooplankton are depended on by so many ocean animals, \u201cthe rest of the food chain will be following on after it,\u201d says Prof Rodhouse.\n\n\u201cIt is a huge movement of biomass every day,\u201d says Prof Rodhouse. \u201cMore than a thousand metres. Some of the oceanic squid probably migrate over 1000m every day.\u201d\n\nHe adds that almost all pelagic species (animals that live in the water column not near the bottom or shore) that can swim make the journey.\n\nHumboldt squid are among the most striking creatures to surface every night. Their ability to change colour and flash bright red when agitated has earned them the nickname \u201cred devils\u201d. Although much smaller than their cousin, the 13m-giant squid, they can reach a length of about 1.5m (almost 5ft). Highly aggressive predators, they capture prey with strong tentacles and suckers and tear into it with powerful beaks, and have reportedly occasionally attacked humans.\n\nBut even ferocious Humboldts are preyed upon by bigger predators such as billfish, swordfish and sharks.\n\n\u201cOf course what they are all doing [by being active at night] is avoiding predation by the top predators,\u201d says Prof Rodhouse. \"The big predators that are visual predators and which stay in the surface waters and see their prey.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo they\u2019re all\u2026 reducing the risk of being preyed on by going down into deep, dark waters at night.\u201d\n\nFor more incredible ocean stories, follow OurBluePlanet on Twitter.

I'm still searching,\" says Jamie Mitchell, World Surf League Big Wave Tour surfer.\n\nFrom highly skilled professional athletes to hobbyists after the rush of the open waves, surfing is enjoyed by people from all walks of life, from all over the planet. All you need is ocean (but not always), a board of some kind, waves, and a lot of enthusiasm.\n\nWhile the tricks and twists of seasoned professionals amaze us, below the surface lies a raft of surfing science as impressive as the feats performed on the waves.\n\nOne wave could power over 30 million smartphones\n\nAnyone who has watched waves crashing will have a sense of their enormous power and it is this power that may prove to be one of the most promising sources for renewable energy; potentially supplying 10% of global needs.\n\nWaves are formed in a number of ways, but in most cases they are created by wind blowing over the surface of the ocean. As long as the wave travels forward slower than the speed of the wind, energy will be transferred from the wind to the wave.\n\nThere are clever and complicated equations that can accurately determine the amount of energy in a wave, but to put it simply the bigger the wave, the bigger the power and there are few places on Earth where the waves are as big as they are at Nazare in Portugal.\n\nThese monster Portuguese waves can reach epic proportions of over 100ft (30.5m) thanks to a combination of the location of the coast and the unique undersea features. Waves generated by storms in the North Atlantic are focused by a deep, arrow-shaped canyon 16,000ft (4877m) below the ocean's surface; these deep water waves then approach the shallow waters of the shore and start to climb up, meaning the waves at Nazare can get big. Real big!\n\n\"Nazare is like a 7th wonder of the World,\" says Mitchell (who is the defending Nazare Challenge winner).\n\n\"To surf waves at Nazare is an honour. You sort of feel like you're back in the day of the gladiators when the world is watching and you're trying to survive and perform at the same time,\" he says.\n\n\"To surf waves at Nazare is an honour.\"\n\nImagine the energy in a wave that stands as tall as an eight-storey building. It is estimated some of the waves at Nazare hold enough energy to power over 30 million smartphone batteries. It could be the ideal location for wave energy farms to harvest all that untapped power.\n\nWaves hide amazing secrets\n\nAside from Nazare, there are a few other \u2018big wave\u2019 spots around the world where the perfect conditions come together to create the kind of waves that surfers dream of.\n\nTeahupo\u02bbo village on the south-west coast of Tahiti is one such place. The waves here are big and steep and with the very real threat of falling onto its razor-sharp reef it has attracted the world\u2019s best and bravest (perhaps craziest) surfers.\n\nThe waves at Teahupo\u02bbo are what scientists call \u201csurging waves\u201d; they aren\u2019t the tallest (the biggest waves are about 30ft / 9.1m high), but they are super thick, formed when deep water suddenly meets a shallow sharp shoreline.\n\nTahiti is a volcanic island and its rapidly growing reef creates a steep break (the point where the top of the wave starts to overtake the bottom causing it to spill over). This should result in large, uneven waves, but the waves at Teahupo\u02bbo are unique and it's all down to geology.\n\nFresh water running down from Tahiti's mountainous region creates channels in the ocean floor where coral cannot grow. These channels funnel water from the shore back into the deeper ocean, creating clean waves and a fast current.\n\nOn top of this, the water coming through the channels builds up the thickness of the wave, making it look like the ocean is rising up, rather than a normal wave\u2019s ripple. The shore is extremely steep and the coral can\u2019t grow too deep leading to a more gradual wave.\n\nAll of these conditions come together to create a wave so intense Teahupo\u02bbo is known as one of the best and most unique \u2018big wave\u2019 surfing spots on the planet.\n\nSurfers can travel faster than city traffic\n\nDriving through a city can be painfully slow at times, particularly during rush hour. So it\u2019ll come as no surprise that average vehicle speed in Europe\u2019s most congested cities is only around 30km per hour (18.6mph), with London faring particularly badly at 19km per hour (11.8mph); a horse-drawn carriage could almost match this speed!\n\nIt was during the 2011 World Surf League\u2019s World Tour circuit in Australia that professional surfer Mick Fanning (nicknamed White Lightning) had his speed measured at an impressive 39.1km per hour (24.3mph); almost 10km per hour faster than you could drive around a city.\n\nOcean animals inspiring surf technology\n\nFound on the underside of a surfboard, fins are critical to the stability, feel and control of the board. Traditionally, fins were rigid and made of wood, but advances in plastics and composite materials have produced fins that allow for greater control while turning on a wave.\n\nNow it seems the future is in fins that mimic whale flippers.\n\nWhales may be massive, but they are also graceful, and it is their ingenious flippers that help them stay so nimble. Their fins allow them to perform some impressive underwater acrobatics, especially in their tight, controlled turns.\n\nTaking cues from whale's fabulous flippers is a new type of fin that flexes from the stiff edge at the front, which first makes contact with the water (leading edge) when in motion, to the fin\u2019s rear edge (trailing edge), with flexibility increasing as the fin tapers from front to back. It also flexes from the base to the tip, like conventional fins do, creating more speed in the turn as the flexing fin snaps back into place.\n\nA second, more radical, fin design has a bumpy irregular surface along the leading edge, modelled after the tubercles on a humpback whale\u2019s flipper. As water flows over their flippers the large bumps create channels of fast-moving water which let the whale \u2018grip\u2019 the water at sharper angles, tightly turning and circling, even at slow speed.\n\nIt\u2019s not just innovative board designs that animals have helped influence, but also the future of surf wear. In an effort to create a more efficient wetsuit (key for surfers who need to stay warm and agile on the waves), MIT engineers looked to the fur of beavers and sea otters for inspiration.\n\nThese semi-aquatic mammals have remarkable fur that traps pockets of air to keep them warm and dry when diving under water. The MIT team fabricated fur-like rubbery pelts mimicking this unique ability to help them understand and ultimately recreate the effect.\n\nA furry wetsuit designed for surfers and inspired by beavers, is very nearly a reality.\n\nSurfboards to monitor our oceans\n\nScientists know that the world\u2019s oceans are changing; they are getting warmer and more acidic, leading to rising sea levels, stormier weather, and altered ecosystems and animal behaviour.\n\nTo measure our changing oceans and the effects on ocean life, scientists use research vessels, probes, sensors and satellites to collect a range of data from the open ocean, but it is much trickier nearer the shore where the waters can be rougher and much more challenging.\n\nAll this may be about to change thanks to a neat piece of tech designed by a team of scientists and used by citizen science surfers.\n\nSmartfin is new technology almost identical to a traditional surf board fin, but with a hidden twist.The fin contains sensors that measure temperature and location for researchers to analyse. In the future, Smartfin hopes its sensors will be able to measure pH, salinity, dissolved oxygen and levels of chlorophyll.\n\nAndrew Stern, founder of Smartfin and Associate Professor of Neurology at University of Rochester School of Medicine, says a Smartfin could help monitor the bleaching of coral reefs due and the populations of shellfish struggling with ocean acidification.\n\n\"What is unique about the Smartfin technology, and why it has taken four years and millions of dollars to develop, is its tiny size and it\u2019s very low cost compared with existing sensors of comparable accuracy.\n\n\"What Smartfin offers is a new generation of sensors that can be easily deployed in huge numbers and in previously inaccessible locations,\u201d he says.\n\nDolphins like to surf\n\nDolphins have been observed riding the crest of big waves towards the shore and heading back out to sea before it breaks; even going out of their way to repeatedly ride the bow waves of large ships and whales, often leaping into the air with what seems like enjoyment.\n\nSo why would dolphins expend energy and waste time for what looks like little benefit? One theory is that they are playing - the behaviour looks to us like fun, it is done intentionally and voluntarily, and is repeated. Importantly, it is not performed when the animal is threatened or competing.\n\nEqually it could also be that using the power of the waves is a more energy efficient way of travelling than swimming underwater. The impact of entering the waves might help to dislodge parasites on the skin, or the splashing noise it makes could also be a signal or communication to other dolphins in the area. There may also be free food when done alongside a fishing vessel, and when done in groups it may teach social bonding.\n\nThe answer could be a combination of any or all these; however, we like to think that perhaps dolphins just love to surf as much as we do!\n\nAmazing aerial feats\n\nAerial surfing is a relatively modern and now common part of many competitions. It takes years to master and relies on the speed of the surfer as well as a light breeze over a vertical lip of at least a two-to-three-foot wave. Approach the lip of the wave at the right angle and it acts as a ramp to launch the surfer and their board into the air before landing back on the water.\n\nThe faster the surfer is riding a wave, the higher in the air they'll go after launch, and the more time in the air there is to pull off an amazing feat - a backflip, a superman, a rodeo flip, or the spectacular sushi roll.\n\n\"When you try something over and over again but don't quite get it right, the moment it finally clicks is so satisfying and you can't help but smile,\" says Lakey Peterson, World Surf League Championship Tour surfer and current world number seven.\n\nSurfing is for everyone\n\nSurfing is enjoyed by people from all walks of life and abilities; all that's needed is a willingness to give it a go and to love the ocean. Standing up on the board and riding those first waves will take practice, but given enough time and dedication you'll be surfing like a pro in no time.\n\n\"It will be the best decision you could ever make,\" says Peterson.\n\n\"Consistency is key and once it all comes together for you, you will be so happy you didn't quit,\" she adds.\n\nJessi Miley-Dyer is World Surf League's Women's Commissioner and former championship competitor and her advice for anyone wanting to take up surfing is to find a surf school and get a few lessons.\n\n\"Make sure that you can swim confidently and don\u2019t be disheartened if you don\u2019t get it straight away! You will be able to stand up, but it\u2019s one of those sports where you just need to keep trying.\n\n\"Give yourself a whole summer to cruise in the ocean and be part of the scene,\" she adds.\n\nYou've read the science, now watch some incredible surfers harnessing the power of the waves:\n\nThis media cannot be played on your device.\n\nFor more incredible ocean stories follow @OurBluePlanet on Twitter, and @BBCEarth on Facebook.

To become actually see through, and appear as if you aren\u2019t there, you need to either allow light to travel through you unimpeded, or bend light around you - so that none reflects back at an observer. It\u2019s a tricky task, but some animals are almost there.\n\nGlass octopus\n\nIn the ocean animals have two choices if they want to hide. Creatures that live in the deep ocean close to the seafloor can blend in with sand or rocks, or hide in coral. In the deep ocean it is often pitch black anyway and predators lack eyes, so being invisible is not necessary.\n\nAnimals that live close to the surface and want to hide can produce dazzling displays of light in a process known as bioluminescence, confusing predators below who think they are looking at dappled sunshine hitting the water\u2019s surface. Animals that live in midwater though have neither of these options. This region is known as the pelagic zone, and it also happens to be where most invisible animals live.\n\nPerhaps the easiest way of becoming invisible is by being transparent and letting light travel completely through you. In open oceans, which lack structures to hide behind, being transparent is a great way of hiding from all viewpoints and angles. It\u2019s so popular in fact that transparency has independently evolved multiple times in completely unrelated animals.\n\nOne such animal, the glass octopus (Vitreledonella richardi) is so named because it is almost completely transparent. The gelatinous creature can grow up to 45cm (18in), if you include the tentacles. It lives 300-1000m below the surface in tropical and subtropical waters across the world, and is almost completely invisible to predators except for its digestive system, optic nerves and eyes.\n\nBut what\u2019s the point in making your whole body transparent, if the eyes and guts are still visible? Even worse, these organs will cast shadows on the seafloor below, making them more visible to predators. Eyes need to absorb light to function, so it is not possible for them to be transparent. Guts betray their contents, so unless an animal feeds on transparent material, they will be visible. However the octopus, and all hosts of transparent creatures go to great lengths to disguise these opaque organs. The glass octopus (Vitreledonella richardi) for example has very elongated eyes which reduces its peripheral vision, but minimises the shadow it casts below - making it less likely to be detected by predators hunting from below. There is also some evidence that it orientates its body in such a way so as to minimise its shadow.\n\nThe glass octopus is not the only transparent animal to come up with an ingenious way of disguising its eyes. Many transparent molluscs camouflage their eyes with mirrors, as mirrors in the open ocean reflect only more ocean and so are invisible.\n\nCranchiidae or glass squid\n\nThe glass family of squid, of which there are about 60 species, are almost entirely see through. They live, again in the pelagic region of oceans around the world, between 200 and 1000m below sea level.\n\nAlthough their bodies are entirely transparent, their large eyes are opaque, which is a problem as predators swimming below can easily see the shadow they cast. However the glass squid (Cranchiidae) uses a clever form of camouflage to hide them. It uses photophores - organs beneath its eyes - to produce light in a trick called counter-illumination. This light looks very similar to the sunlight filtering down from above, so it makes the squid completely invisible to predators swimming below it. However the light could make the squid very conspicuous to viewers looking at it from other angles. Rather than an invisibility cloak, the glowing light could act like a beacon drawing predators to it.\n\nResearchers from the University of Pennsylvania found that the squid\u2019s photophores are amazingly able to match the amount of light they produce to that coming in from every direction, creating a sort of omnidirectional invisibility cloak.\n\nThe tomopteris deep sea worm\n\nThis genus, or group of marine planktonic polychaete worms are almost completely transparent, making them very difficult for predators to see. Paradoxically at least 11 species in the group can also emit bright luminous colours. Most tomopteris worms glow blue, but one species, Tomopteris nisseni can produce yellow light and is one of only few such creatures on the planet to do so.\n\nSome tomopteris worms can even distract predators by releasing a glowing part of their body called a parapodia, making the predator chase after the dispelled body part rather than the worm itself.\n\nSea salp\n\nA salp is a completely transparent barrel shaped creature which swims and feeds at the same time by pumping water through its gelatinous body. They filter out the phytoplankton in the water to feed on. Although they look a bit like jellyfish they are actually more sophisticated and are closely related to fish and vertebrates - they have a heart and gills and can reproduce sexually.\n\nSalps have a fascinating life cycle. For part of it they live by themselves, but they then clone themselves and form long strings and other shapes of connected organisms. Individual salps synchronise their swimming by communicating with one another via electrical signals.\n\nHyperiids\n\nSometimes being transparent isn\u2019t enough, and organisms need other tricks up their sleeve to remain invisible. This is certainly the case for the Hyperiid, a little crustacean bearing a resemblance to a shrimp. They are able to hide from predators by being transparent. However that only gets them so far. A plane of glass is also transparent but you can still see it if you shine a light on it, as the light is reflected back. This is a particular problem in the ocean because many predators use bioluminescence as a searchlight when hunting for prey.\n\nA recent study suggests there is more to the hyperiid\u2019s ability to hide than simple transparency. It turns out they are using a kind of nanotechnology to interfere with and bend light, cloaking themselves and almost rendering them invisible. The scientists used a scanning electron microscope to closely analyse seven species of hyperiids. They found that the legs of one species were covered in tiny nano sized hair-like protuberances.\n\nThe body of this species, and six others were also covered in nano sized bumps or spheres ranging in size from under 100 nanometers to around 300 nanometers. The tiny size of the bumps could minimise light scattering and the scientists found that a combination of both nanostructures - the bumps and the hairs could reduce reflectance by as much as 100 fold. The weird thing is that the researchers think these spheres could actually be bacteria.\n\nJapetella heathi and Onychoteuthis banksii\n\nThe squid Japetella heathi and the octopus Onychoteuthis banksii also have a novel trick up their sleeves when it comes to invisibility - they can quickly switch from being transparent to a reddish brown colour.\n\nThey both live in the Pacific Ocean between 600-1000m deep \u2013 known as the mesopelagic zone. Although being transparent helps a lot with invisibility close to the water\u2019s surface, as diffuse sunlight from the surface passes straight through transparent tissue, when you shine a light directly on something that is transparent, it suddenly becomes very visible.\n\nUnfortunately this happens quite a lot in the deep sea, where predators use light-emitting organs called photophores like a searchlight when hunting. Prey at these depths are often red or black so that they reflect as little blue light as possible. Japetella heathi, an octopus, and Onychoteuthis banksii, a squid, are able to switch between both, but how do they do it? Both species\u2019 skin contains light sensitive cells called chromatophores. The cells contain a dye, and when they detect light they immediately expand and release the pigment.\n\nSea Sapphires\n\nSea Sapphires (Sapphirina) are ant size creatures that live in warm tropical and subtropical seas. They belong to a group of crustaceans called copepods. Different species emit a range of brilliant iridescent colours, from vivid blues to reds and golds.\n\nWhat is remarkable about them is that one second they can shimmer brightly and the next they appear almost to disappear and the way they do this is fascinating. Their skin, or cuticle cells contain tiny crystal plates arranged in a hexagonal honeycomb pattern. The crystals contain guanine, one of the four bases that make up DNA. The crystal layers are separated from each other by a soup-like fluid called a cytosol.\n\nA team of scientists found that the although the layers of guanine crystals are always exactly the same thickness \u2013 70 nanometers, the thickness of the cytosol between the layers varies from 50 to 200 nanometers. It is this variety which determines the colour of the sea sapphire. Thicker layers of cytosol lead to longer wavelengths of light being reflected, which make the copepod look red or magenta.\n\nThe colour also depends on the angle of light which strikes them. As the angle becomes smaller and smaller, the wavelength of reflected light becomes shorter and the colour more violet. If the angle becomes small enough then the reflected light is in the UV spectrum, which means that we can\u2019t see it and the sea sapphires disappear. The researchers found that light which hit the crustaceans at a 45\u00b0 angle effectively caused them to become invisible.\n\nThe glasswing butterfly\n\nAll of the transparent animals discussed so far have lived in the sea, and there\u2019s a good reason for that. To be transparent you need to be made up of stuff that neither absorbs nor reflects light. This is a difficult task for plants and animals that live on land because there is such a large difference between the refractive index of living tissues and air. The refractive index of a material describes how quickly light travels through it. Light travels fastest in a vacuum, and generally speaking the denser a material, the longer light takes to travel through it and the greater its refractive index will be.\n\nAs biological tissue is so much thicker and denser than air, when light waves go from travelling through air to body tissue, they slow down. This causes light to change directions and scatter, causing reflections that make the animal more visible.\n\nIn the sea there is less difference between the refractive index of water and biological tissues, so transparency is an easier task, hence why there are so many \u2018almost\u2019 invisible animals. Another reason you don\u2019t find many see through animals on land is because organisms need pigments like melanin to protect them from UV radiation from the sun.\n\nHowever there are some exceptions to the see through rule. One is the glasswing butterfly (Greta oto) which lives in Central America.\n\nAlthough not all of its body is see through, its transparent wings make it difficult for predators to track it during flight. To look at how the butterfly achieves its transparency, scientists examined their wings under an electron microscope. They found tiny nano sized bumps called nanopillars which were scattered randomly and had different lengths. It seems that the random size and distribution of the nanoscale structures help the butterfly minimise reflections from its wings. The nanopillars interfere with rays of light hitting the wing, causing most to pass straight through rather than bouncing back.\n\nTransparent mollusc\n\nAnother exception to the rule is a translucent snail (Zospeum tholussum) that was discovered in the deepest cave in Croatia. Scientists from Goethe University, Frankfurt found the see through mollusc living 980m underground in the Lukina Jama-Trojama cave, in a chamber full of rocks and sand with a small stream running through it.\n\nThe snail belongs to a genus of miniature land snails that are found in dark, underground caves, and which are unable to move by themselves. Researchers believe they use running water from streams to transport themselves.\n\nHowever even though it is translucent, the snail is still fairly visible, highlighting just how difficult it is for land animals to achieve what those in the ocean do.\n\nNever miss a moment.

These are just some of the words that can be used to describe an otter. If you\u2019ve been lucky enough to see one of these shy semi-aquatic animals in the wild, you\u2019ll instantly understand why.\n\nBut despite all their lovable qualities, otter populations all over the world hang in the balance.\n\nBecause they haven\u2019t always been appreciated (at least not alive), sea otters were almost hunted to extinction for their warm and luxurious pelts. More recently, many species including the common, or Eurasian, otter have been hunted and trapped because they were seen as threats to fish stocks and competition for our food. Sometimes they were even killed for fun.\n\nIt is not just deliberate hunting, trapping and persecution that cause otters to suffer; they have to cope with shrinking habitats and a shortage of food, are vulnerable to chemicals, pollutants and (for some species) oil spills. Accidentally getting caught in fishing nets, parasites and infectious diseases are yet further causes of fatalities.\n\nThese are big problems and a tall order for any group of animals to deal with.\n\nDespite all these challenges, they are fighters with a range of skills and behaviours making them superbly adapted to life on land and in water.\n\nFound on every continent except Oceania and Antarctica, not one of the 13 species has yet become extinct.\n\nThis says a lot about the tenacious nature of these members of the mustelid family, but also about the efforts many organisations and individuals have played in their conservation. The approaches and use of technology may differ vastly in different parts of the world, but the long-term survival of the species is what matters.\n\nSea otters in California\n\nIt was a close call for the incredibly cute sea otter (Enhydra lutris) though.\n\nDuring the fur trade of the 1700s and 1800s, the worldwide sea otter population was reduced from as many as 300,000 animals to as few as 2000, explains Andrew Johnson, Monterey Bay Aquarium\u2019s Conservation Research Operations Manager.\n\nThey were relentlessly hunted for their pelts. With around a million hairs per square inch, it was regarded as one of the most prized animal furs in the world.\n\nAlong the Californian coast, the southern sea otter (Enhydra lutris nereis) was persecuted particularly badly, where numbers in the early 1900s were down to around 50 individuals (from 15,000) and were close to being wiped out.\n\nThankfully, they are now protected and their numbers have recovered to around 125,000 - though they remain an endangered species.\n\nHealthy populations have a profound effect on the overall health of kelp forests, estuaries, and coastal and ocean ecosystems, because, Johnson says, \u201cWhen sea otters are absent, those systems often fall out of balance and become less diverse and resilient.\u201d\n\nMonterey Bay Aquarium in California has worked with sea otters since it opened in 1984 and now operates a successful sea otter rescue and release programme, using state-of-the-art facilities and tracking implants to help them in their vital work.\n\nTo help stranded sea otters, they have an Intensive Care Unit and multiple enclosures filled with filtered seawater with the capacity to hold 10 animals at one time. To monitor their progress once back in the wild, they use radio transmitters.\n\n\u201cWe implant the transmitters so that we can track each otter and watch its behaviour following release,\u201d he says.\n\nBecause the batteries last at least two years, young animals can often be tracked until they reach adulthood and reproduce, allowing the team to document the significant impact releasing sea otters into an area has on the ecosystem.\n\nLargely due to legislation and the conservation work of dedicated organisations and charities such as Monterey Bay Aquarium, there is good news for California\u2019s southern sea otters, as numbers are now up to 3000.\n\n\u201cThis charismatic and vital species would not have survived without these protections.\n\n\u201cWe need them to survive so they can exert positive effects on kelp forests and estuarine habitats, making those areas healthier and more ecologically diverse,\u201d Johnson says.\n\nHairy-nosed otters in Cambodia\n\nNot all approaches to conservation are so well funded, but this doesn\u2019t mean they are any less successful.\n\nThe hairy-nosed otter (Lutra sumatrana) is one of the rarest and most endangered species of otter. In the 1990s, it was thought extinct throughout its range in Southeast Asia due to habitat loss, poaching, local consumption of otter meat and a loss of its sources of food.\n\nHowever, surveying between 2006 and 2013 at possible habitats confirmed the presence of several small populations. In Cambodia, for example, it was found in four areas; one of the largest populations being around the flooded forest surrounding the Tonle Sap Lake.\n\nNow the species has been \u2018rediscovered\u2019, it needs to be protected so that the populations can be allowed to grow. And that\u2019s where organisations such as Conservation International have worked to protect and conserve the area and the species.\n\nAs Sokrith Heng, Conservation International\u2019s lead researcher for the survey, explains, even though there are a number of laws and regulations to protect the species, enforcement on the ground is weak and limited and local people\u2019s awareness of the importance of the wildlife and ecosystems they live in is very limited.\n\nPoverty in areas such as rural Cambodia can also be a problem and often pushes local communities to use natural resources in unsustainable ways.\n\nIn response to this, Conservation International took action at Tonle Sap Lake. Their approach was to restore critical habitat, raise awareness in local communities and schools, and suggest laws and regulations to better protect the species. They also established conservation zones, protecting these through collaboration with government and community rangers as well as helping local community fisheries to development alternative livelihoods.\n\nKey to this was directly engaging local community members in otter research and forming a group of \u2018otter ambassadors\u2019 who help spread awareness resulting in stronger support from locals.\n\nThis is important Heng says because; \u201cEducating local people means they can share their knowledge to other community members.\u201d\n\nAn important part of the successful conservation here is ensuring that local communities are able to sustainably use and manage their resources, and that the communities are financially stronger, explains Heng. For example, some community fisheries now have better protection for the otters: they are patrolling the area to stop illegal activities and teaching otter conservation in the local area.\n\nAt Tonle Sap Lake, these approaches resulted in fewer otter traps and skins being recorded by officials and researchers, both signs that fewer animals were being killed. While ongoing habitat restoration combined with less hunting and greater awareness is helping to ensure a brighter future for the hairy-nosed otter.\n\nAlthough the technology maybe very different to that used at Monterey Bay, this method of conservation has been just as successful, as hairy-nosed otters now have at least one stronghold in Cambodia.\n\nIt is a good result for the country and for a species that was once thought extinct.\n\nUK viewers can watch Natural World: Supercharged Otters on iPlayer.\n\nNever miss a moment.

The ancient Egyptians were really into them, for some reason.\n\nReality: From South America to South Africa, the UK to the USA, they will be there. Not only are dung beetles a diverse and multifaceted group of insects, they keep our farmland fertile and our pests and parasites at bay, and even play a part in reducing greenhouse gas emissions. They do not all eat dung, either.\n\nThe dung beetle was an icon in ancient Egypt, adorning temples, jewellery and texts. It was the symbol of a god who rolled the Sun up over the horizon each day, just like an enormous ball of dung. To this day, this is the stereotypical dung beetle, the one made famous by natural history films \u2013 a stocky black insect, trundling along with its smelly ball.\n\n\"I get that a lot,\" says insect ecologist Tomas Roslin at the Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences, \"and then hurry to point out that there are as many different species of beetles living in dung as there are, for example, bird species globally\".\n\nThe sacred scarab of Egypt is a real animal, but it is just the tip of the dung heap. Dung beetles can be big or small, adorned with beautiful colours or horns to fight opponents, and inhabit chilly grasslands or tropical rainforests. Of the thousands of dung beetle species, only a fraction actually roll their dung into balls, and many do not eat dung at all.\n\n\"With so many different species that exist globally, the differences in life history are almost endless,\" says Trond Larsen, a tropical ecologist and Director of Conservation International's Rapid Assessment Program. \"Among the most fascinating dung beetle species are those which have developed unusual specialisations.\"\n\nMost dung beetles work hard to live up to their name. In their quest for dung, some species engage in epic kung fu battles on the savannah. Others take up residence by monkeys' anuses, so they can hop onto the dung as it leaves its owner: a perfect example of \"first come, first serve\".\n\nBut according to Larsen, it is common to find over 150 distinct dung beetle species at a single site in the tropics. With this level of competition for limited quantities of dung, it is hardly surprising that some have evolved non dung-based diets.\n\nThese diets would still not be to everyone's taste. Whether it is carrion, rotting fruit and fungi, or dead invertebrates, dung beetles seem happy to serve as nature's bin men, hoovering up unpleasant detritus and waste. One species lives on the backs of giant land snails, sucking up their mucus while enjoying a free ride.\n\nPerhaps the most fascinating specialists are the dung beetles that have made the switch from dung to hunting prey.\n\nPredatory dung beetles have long been alluded to in the scientific literature. One species from Brazil was recorded decapitating large ants, before leaving their heads behind and rolling the fat abdomens into an underground lair \u2013 as if they were balls of dung.\n\nMost of all, though, some dung beetles really seem to have it in for millipedes.\n\nAware of reports that certain beetles attack live millipedes, Larsen decided to go in search of the killer. After identifying a likely Peruvian species called Deltochilum valgum, he captured some specimens to observe their behaviour. \"I was amazed to unravel the highly detailed attack strategies employed by the beetles,\" he enthuses. Once again, decapitation is their favoured mode of attack.\n\nHowever, thanks to their family history of eating dung, these beetles lack the sharp mouthparts commonly found in carnivorous animals. Instead, they have to improvise.\n\n\"Successful decapitation of millipedes depends on a suite of morphological adaptations, such as the shape of the hind legs, the prying 'teeth' on the front of the head, and the narrow width of the head for fitting inside the millipede's body segments,\" says Larsen. Essentially, the dung beetles slowly prise their unfortunate prey's body apart.\n\nMillipedes are commonplace and slow, making them the perfect prey for these makeshift predators. Larsen reckons the evolutionary leap from feeding on carrion and dead invertebrates to living millipedes is not huge, and predicts that other dung beetles will also make the switch.\n\nClarke Scholtz, a veteran entomologist at the University of Pretoria in South Africa, knows a thing or two about dung beetles. He says that millipede-eaters are also present across the Atlantic, and agrees that this lifestyle change is actually rather straightforward.\n\n\"Adult dung beetles are not dung feeders in the strictest sense of the word,\" says Scholtz. \"They feed on tiny particles of gut epithelium from whatever it was that produced the dung, bacteria, fungi and tiny fractions of dung.\"\n\nMeanwhile, carrion-feeding dung beetles, and those feeding on invertebrates, are slurping on smoothies of juices and insides, filtering out the nutritious particles just as they would with dung.\n\nDespite their forays into other foodstuffs, the primary business of the dung beetle family is still, well, \"business\". Whether they roll it around, bury it or live inside it, these beetles know their way around a pile of poop, and have done since the time of the dinosaurs.\n\nWhat's more, while they are not pushing the Sun across the sky, dung beetles are doing important work.\n\n\"Dung beetles are an essential part of the ecosystem,\" says Bryony Sands of the University of Bristol, UK. \"In my opinion, they are as important as bees, but because of their unglamorous lifestyle their value is definitely overlooked.\"\n\nFaeces are a fact of life, and without an efficient waste disposal system the world would quickly descend into a swamp of unprocessed sewage. Dung beetles are that system. \"The beetles process the dung by tunnelling, burying, and fragmenting it,\" says Sands. They lay their eggs in it, their larvae eat it, worms bury it further, and the circle of dung continues.\n\nScholtz puts the situation into perspective. \"We have 15 million cattle in South Africa, and each produces about 12 cow pats per day,\" he says. \"That equates to about 5,500 tonnes of dung every day. We would all be knee deep \u2013 or shoulder deep \u2013 in it if it wasn't for dung beetles.\" And that is before we even consider the elephant dung.\n\n\"This whole process not only quickly and efficiently removes dung from the surface, it brings all those important nutrients back down into the soil, making the soil fertile and our pastures productive,\" says Sands.\n\nIn the UK, which is home to a mere 60 species of dung beetle compared to South Africa's 800, the ecosystem services provided by dung beetles could be saving the cattle industry \u00a3367 million each year. Comparable savings have been estimated in the USA. Not only are dung beetles boosting pasture fertility, they also disperse seeds, improve soil structure, and reduce the prevalence of pests and parasites that affect both humans and livestock.\n\nIn a 2016 study, Sands showed that dung beetles reduce the spread of intestinal worms in cattle. Unfortunately, the anti-worm drugs farmers give to their cattle come out in their dung, and that is bad news for the beetles. \"This is a bit of a catch-22,\" says Sands. \"The very chemicals that farmers are using to treat the gut worms are actually killing the dung beetles, which would be naturally reducing worm transmission on pasture, making the problem worse in the long run.\"\n\nIndeed, the tremendous value of dung beetles has not gone unnoticed. Some pioneering scientists have used them to orchestrate major ecological changes.\n\nThe most dramatic instance of dung beetle intervention began in Australia in the 1960s, when the country was facing a dung disaster. Native dung beetles were used to the dry, hard dung of marsupials, not the sloppy pats left by introduced cattle. This led to farmlands covered with cow dung and bush fly swarms of biblical proportions.\n\nIn a bold move, the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO) established the Australian Dung Beetle Project. Over two decades, a team introduced 53 species of dung beetles from around the world. The foreign beetles were able to beat back the tide of manure, leading to a drop of about 90% in bush fly numbers. As a side note, it has been argued that the decline in flies has also saved the country's outdoor caf\u00e9s from extinction.\n\nSuch was the success of the project that it has been repeated both in Australia and in neighbouring New Zealand, and this is not the final word on dung beetle interventions. \"CSIRO and other Australian and New Zealand researchers have not concluded their efforts in the dung beetle space,\" says Patrick Gleeson, a research technician at CSIRO. He mentions a recent application to develop a new, national dung beetle project.\n\nTo add to a growing list of dung beetle powers, work by Roslin and his colleagues has also found evidence that dung beetles can reduce greenhouse gas emissions.\n\n\"We are talking fairly big effects, like a reduction of 40% of total methane emissions from any single dung pat inhabited by beetles,\" Roslin says. \"Dung beetle tunnels will serve as ventilation shafts, bringing oxygen into the pat. That will shift the balance between different microbes. Methane-producing microbes don't like oxygen.\"\n\nWhen you consider the emissions from an entire food supply chain, Roslin says, the impact of beetles is relatively small. Nevertheless, this addition to dung beetles's CV is yet another reminder of their significance.\n\nIn Finland, where Roslin conducted his studies, the tiny beetles are a far cry from the ostentatious, mouse-sized creatures found in Africa. But they are still playing their role, epitomising the biologist E.O. Wilson's reference to \"the little things that run the world\".\n\n\"Remember, dung beetles are not just something you see struggling with balls of elephant dung on African savannahs,\" says Sands. \"They are right here at home on your doorstep, and they need to be looked after!\"", "authors": ["Josh Gabbatiss"], "url": "http://www.bbc.com/earth/story/20170608-some-dung-beetles-have-taken-to-decapitating-millipedes"}, {"title": "The most powerful punches and kicks of all time", "text": "Few things get the adrenalin spiking quite like a big brawl, even if you are just a popcorn-guzzling spectator. But if you want the real ultimate fighters you need to look to nature, where champions compete for more than glory: they fight to survive.\n\nThe hardest hitters on Earth are highly likely to take you by surprise, and not just because of their speed and skill.\n\nThe owners of possibly the fastest punch known to science are marine crustaceans called mantis shrimps. They use specialised forelimbs to strike prey with shocking power. The force is so great that the mantis shrimps tear through the water, creating small implosions that generate heat, light and sound.\n\nSome species have adapted specialised appendages to spear, like a harpoon, while others smash with a club. In captivity, they have been known to break aquarium glass with a single hit.\n\nMany social insects clash by knocking their antennae together\n\nSheila Patek's laboratory at Duke University in North Carolina specialises in studying fast animal movements. Patek's team has discovered that peacock mantis shrimps can generate a force peaking at nearly 2,500 times their body weight in less than 800 microseconds.\n\nPatek says springs, levers and latches are the key to this amazing ability. Within each mantis shrimp's appendage is a four-bar linkage system that manages force. One link pushes against the next, building up energy before it is unleashed through the harpoon or club segment.\n\n\"Much like an archer, the mantis shrimp stores up elastic energy in advance of the strike and releases it with a latch,\" says Patek.\n\nThe shrimps also engage in territorial contests. However, Patek and colleagues describe these encounters as \"ritualised sparring\" rather than lethal contests. Competing shrimps first size each other up, and only come to blows as a last resort. On the rare occasions that they physically fight, the shrimps first curl up their armoured tailplates, or telsons, to shield their abdomens. The winner is the shrimp that, like Rocky Balboa, can withstand the most hits.\n\nPatek has also studied insects called trap-jaw ants. These insects are named for their mouth parts, which can snap shut on prey astonishingly fast.\n\nHares often fight duels in spring as the mating season begins\n\nThey also brawl to settle disputes, boxing one another with their antennae to determine hierarchy within the nest.\n\nMany social insects clash by knocking their antennae together: the behaviour has been studied in ants, wasps and bees. Touching antennae does not always signal a beatdown: for example, honeybees rapidly touch antennae while exchanging food. But for letting others know who is boss, boxing is key.\n\nIn a 2016 study, researchers used high-speed cameras to record four species of trap-jaw ants boxing with their antennae. The Florida native Odontomachus brunneus struck its opponent 41.5 times per second. The team described trap-jaw ants as \"the fastest boxers ever recorded\".\n\nAmong mammals, probably the most famous thumpers are brown hares (Lepus europaeus).\n\nHares often fight duels in spring as the mating season begins. This is the origin of the phrase \"mad as a March hare\".\n\nIt was once believed that only male hares fought, competing for mates by swiping at their opponent with their front paws. However, modern research has shown that boxing matches are often started by females, who are not yet ready to mate and choose to fight off pushy suitors. Females only have brief windows of fertility, so males must be persistent.\n\nKangaroos also kick in self-defence, as many unfortunate Australian dog-walkers can attest\n\nIn Australia, the bulging biceps of male kangaroos signal more sexually-charged scuffling. A particularly ripped specimen known as Roger resides at the Kangaroo Sanctuary in Alice Springs, and has become a viral hit thanks to his bucket-crushing guns.\n\nAccording to a 2013 study, the males' over-developed forelimb muscles are a result of sexual selection. Male kangaroos slap and grapple one another to settle disputes over mates, and bigger muscles give them an advantage.\n\nBut it is kick-boxing where kangaroos really excel. With his opponent in a solid headlock, a dominant male can drive the message home \u2013 balancing on his tail and pummelling with his powerful legs, which are tipped with sharp claws.\n\nKangaroos also kick in self-defence, as many unfortunate Australian dog-walkers can attest. And speaking of kicks, a kick from a hoof can leave an even greater impression.\n\nAnyone that has spent time with horses know they can deliver a mean kick, especially if they buck to deliver a blow with both hind feet.\n\nA zebra's kick is rumoured to be even more menacing, but the evidence to support this is purely anecdotal. Zebras are known to be harder to tame than horses, which might be why the idea that their kicks are more savage is so widespread.\n\nThe secretarybird may look pretty ridiculous, but it feeds on venomous snakes\n\nTim Caro of the University of California Davis has dedicated much of his career to studying zebras \u2013 even going so far as to dress up as a zebra to study them in the wild. In his 2016 book Zebra Stripes, he describes how plains zebras deal with predators. Video footage has shown that the zebras kick lions in the chest, but there is no scientific record of these kicks being fatal.\n\nOther beasts that can really stick the boot in include ostriches and giraffes. Both have been recorded kicking out at, and wounding, large predators. In 2016, Planet Earth II gave us remarkable footage of a giraffe besting a lion with a well-placed kick. When you consider the ferocious jaws that might be snapping at their heels, it is little wonder that these animals can punt some serious punishment.\n\nYet these defensive moves are not intended to kill so much as repel. While a chance blow to a spine or jaw could prove deadly, the kicks are mostly a distraction to give the leggy prey animals a chance to run for safety.\n\nFor truly lethal strikes, we need to look at predators \u2013 especially those with difficult diets.\n\nStalking through the grasslands of sub-Saharan Africa is a predator researchers have described as a \"ninja eagle on stilts\". The secretarybird may look pretty ridiculous, but it feeds on venomous snakes, dispatching them with a single violent kick to the head.\n\nZebras are known to be harder to tame than horses\n\nIn a 2016 study, scientists measured the kicking ability of a captive male secretarybird called, for reasons that are not immediately clear, Madeleine. They found that Madeleine could deliver five or six times his own bodyweight in a tenth of the time it takes a human to blink.\n\nThis same hunting style may also have been employed by some of the aptly-named terror birds: huge flightless birds that lived in prehistoric South America. Members of the Mesembriornis genus had very strong legs, according to analyses of recovered bone fragments. This has prompted scientists to suggest that the birds might have dished out bone-shattering kicks, as a way to access the nutritious bone marrow of their prey.\n\nPerhaps we should all forget about floating like a butterfly and stinging like a bee, and instead focus on punching like a shrimp and kicking like a bird.", "authors": ["Ella Davies"], "url": "http://www.bbc.com/earth/story/20170605-the-most-powerful-punches-and-kicks-of-all-time"}, {"title": "'Pirate spiders' make a living by preying on other spiders", "text": "Build a web, catch a fly, wrap the fly in silk, then devour at leisure. This hunting strategy has proven so effective that orb-weaving spiders are one of the most successful groups of animals. They are found in almost every corner of the world and there are more than 3,000 species.\n\nMaking a web is a fairly sophisticated ploy. As well as multiple forms of silk and glue, the spider needs to perform a sequence of precise manoeuvres.\n\nBut why bother building your own web, when you can just invade somebody else's and devour the architect?\n\nA clandestine group of spiders known as \"pirates\" have adopted this nefarious method of nabbing their prey. Their hunting strategies are among the most remarkable in the animal kingdom.\n\nPirate spiders are members of the spider group that includes all the \"orb weavers\" \u2013 those that make the prototypical, circular webs we are all familiar with \u2013 but they do not make webs.\n\nIn fact, they have lost the ability. They can still produce silk, which they use to build egg sacs and wrap prey. But they are anatomically incapable of spinning a web. The number of silk \"spigots\" on their spinnerets is dramatically small compared to their relatives.\n\nInstead, they invade the webs of other spiders, in a bid to lure and then kill the hapless architect. Gently, they pluck the strings of the web, enticing the host to approach.\n\nOnce the host spider has ventured close enough, the pirate makes its move.\n\nFirst, it encloses its duped prey within its two enormous front legs. These are fringed with massive spines, called \"macrosetae\", which they use to trap the host within a prison-like basket.\n\nThen, the final move: the pirate bites its prey and uses its fangs to inject a powerful venom that instantly immobilises it.\n\nIt is a powerfully effective hunting technique.\n\n\"It can be riveting to watch a pirate stealthily wandering while waving its long, first pair of legs to narrow in on the location of the other spider,\" says Mark Townley of the University of New Hampshire. \"Despite many hours spent feeding pirates for our studies on spinnerets, I never became jaded by the sight of them searching for and attacking prey. It was always a marvel to watch. They can wield that first pair of legs so delicately that I've seen them touch prey spiders so lightly without them reacting in any way, not seeming to even notice.\"\n\nBut we do not yet fully understand how the pirate's strategy works.\n\nIn particular, it is not clear why the pirate spiders pluck the strings of the host spider's web.\n\nIt has long been assumed that the plucking mimics the vibrations caused by an ensnared insect. Hence the Latin name for pirate spiders: Mimetidae, or \"imitator\".\n\nHowever, not all entomologists agree that this is what the pirate spiders are doing.\n\n\"The behaviour of resident spiders towards pirate spiders and their own prey is quite different, as are the vibrations in the web caused by these two sources,\" says Carl Kloock of California State University Bakersfield.\n\nHe has an alternative suggestion. \"It seems to me most likely that pirate spiders are mimicking the vibrations of web-invading spiders of the same species, and possibly spiders of different species,\" says Kloock. \"A spider on its web needs to defend its web \u2013 a valuable resource \u2013 from other spiders, who may try to take over the web to avoid the cost of building their own web, or simply try to steal prey from the web.\"\n\n\"These encounters follow a pretty simple pattern, where the spiders signal at one another, then slowly approach each other, usually until the smaller spider gives up and flees the web.\n\n\"I think what the pirate spiders are doing is basically sending a deceptive signal representing themselves as small web invaders that refuse to flee, drawing the resident closer and closer until they are within attack range,\" Kloock adds.\u200b \u200b\n\nThen there is the matter of pirate spider venom, which has evolved to be extremely toxic towards other spiders, including members of their own species, but not towards other animals.\n\n\"Once another spider has been bitten it ceases to move, whereas fruit flies may struggle for several minutes,\" says Daniel Mott of Texas A&M International University. \"Their toxins appear to be very specific to other spiders.\"\n\nWhy, and how, could such a strange hunting strategy evolve?\n\nThe first problem is that the prey spiders are also predators, equipped with fangs and venom. This means they are more dangerous than, say, beetles or flies, and also less abundant.\n\nSecondly, pirate spiders are specialist predators. While they do sometimes feast on other prey, their main source of food is always spiders. By comparison, most orb-weaving spiders are generalist predators, eating whatever wanders into their web.\n\nIn fact, pirates are not even capable of capturing other spiders without the web to stand on.\n\n\"In the lab, if you put an orb weaver into a jar but don't allow it to spin a web, the pirate spider will not attack it,\" says Danilo Harms of the University of Hamburg in Germany. \"It needs a web in order to capture another spider.\"\n\nSomehow, the ancestors of pirate spiders both lost the ability to weave their own webs, and became predators of other spiders to boot.\n\nHarms says the most plausible explanation is that it began with thievery. Pirate spiders' ancestors may have started invading the webs of other spiders, in order to steal the insects that the host had painstakingly trapped, poisoned and stored.\n\nThis filching behaviour has a colourful name: \"kleptoparasitism\".\n\nSome of the proto-pirates could have then taken this tactic to the next level, by preying on the host spiders themselves. Over time, they would then have become increasingly specialised for capturing other spiders: evolving unusually long front legs, sophisticated web-plucking behaviours, and spider-specific venom.\n\nThis idea has been dubbed the \"kleptoparasitism-origin hypothesis\".\n\nWhatever the reason for their quirky behaviour, pirate spiders are highly successful. Scientists have formally described more than 160 species, and they are found on every continent except Antarctica.\n\n\"We know a little bit about the biology of a tiny fraction of pirate spiders, but for most of the species we know literally nothing about their life history and behaviour,\" says Gustavo Hormiga of George Washington University. \"For example, virtually nothing is known about the biology of the beautifully bizarre South American tropical pirate spiders of the genus Gelanor.\"\n\nIn this genus, the males' pedipalps \u2013 modified legs, which they use for inseminating females \u2013 are twice the length of the male's body. It may be that this allows them to inseminate females from a distance. \"In all other spiders, copulation requires that both partners are close to each other,\" says Hormiga. Mating at a distance would be a useful precaution, as pirate spiders are aggressive, possess potent venom, and are primed to prey on other arachnids, including their own kind.\n\nBut they also have a gentler side.\n\nIn a study published in November 2016 in the journal Cladistics, Hormiga and his student Ligia Benavides described five new species. Their study also featured the first report of female pirate spiders caring for their young.\n\nMaternal care is relatively common in spiders. Some merely regurgitate prey for their young, while others go as far as allowing their spiderlings to feast upon their corpse. But maternal care had never been seen in the seemingly \"nasty\" pirate spiders.\n\n\"In the field, we observed females of Mimetus, Anansi and Ero taking care of eggs and spiderlings. Pirates can be good mothers,\" says Benavides. \"In some instances, females had their eggs distributed evenly in a small web on the underside of a leaf. But if I moved a web or touched the spider, she would gather all the eggs or spiderlings quickly, create a ball with them, and carry them away in order to protect them.\"\n\nPirate spiders are clearly a tale unto themselves. However, their habit of imitating prey in order to devour another spider \u2013 an act known as \"aggressive mimicry\" \u2013 is not unique to them. It has evolved in arachnids independently at least twice before.\n\nThere is a genus of jumping spiders known as Portia. These spiders also mimic prey, pluck the webs of unlucky host spiders, and devour them.\n\nLike other jumping spiders, Portia spiders have enormous eyes and mostly rely on vision to seek out their prey. In contrast, pirates seem to rely more on their sense of touch. In the lab, covering their eyes with paint does little to hinder their attacks on other spiders.\n\nPirates and Portia spiders are fairly recent evolutionary developments. However, \"pelican spiders\" also feast on other arachnids \u2013 and they are so ancient, they pre-date the evolution of winged insects.\n\nPelican spiders owe their nickname to their phenomenally large jaws (technically \"chelicerae\") and elongated necks. Formally known as Archaeidae, they are also sometimes called \"assassin spiders\".\n\nWith one chelicera they spear their prey. With the other, they inject the dangling, impaled spider with venom.\n\nPelican spiders have always preyed on other spiders \u2013 unlike the mimetids, which evolved from web-spinning spiders. They were first discovered from fossilised specimens in 1854, according to Harms, before living specimens were found in Madagascar in 1881.\n\n\"So, if you are older than the radiation of insects, what could you eat? Potentially other spiders,\" says Harms. \"That's why they have such strange morphology.\"\n\nStrange as it may seem, for some spiders feasting on the flesh of their spidery cousins is a great way to make a living.\n\nNever miss a moment.

The aircraft crashed in 1944 after getting hit by anti-aircraft fire, killing co-pilot, Ernest Vienneau.\n\n\u201cIn years to come, many of the ships and aircraft lost during the World Wars will be gone forever.\u201d\n\nDiving such sites can be both \u201cexhilarating and spectacular\u201d and \u201csombre and sad\u201d when there has been loss of life, says Jones; something that hit home particularly hard on this shoot.\n\nThe images Jones captured ended up having a surprisingly personal impact after he entered the photographs in the Underwater Photographer of the Year awards. His entry was published and spotted by the late co-pilot's family who got in touch with Jones.\n\n\u201cThey had never seen images of his resting place,\u201d says Jones. \u201cThe follow-on correspondence meant even more to me than the dive itself.\u201d\n\n\u201cFrom descending into the massive cylindrical turret armour of the WW1 Battleship HMS Audacious, to seeing the deck of the WW2 wreck SS Empire Heritage covered in Sherman tanks, I\u2019m frequently left in awe of what I\u2019ve seen,\u201d he says.\n\nBut these relics from one of the bloodiest chapters in human history are slowly disappearing.\n\n\u201cIn years to come many of the ships and aircraft lost during the World Wars will be gone forever,\u201d says Jones.\n\nSince wrecks deteriorate over time, he says, photographing them is \u201ccapturing a point in history that will never be seen again\u201d.\n\n\u201cUnderwater photography and scuba diving is a form of meditation.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen you dive on a wreck that has lain on the seabed, sometimes over a hundred years, it's like time stood still,\u201d says Anders Nyberg, a freelance photographer from the Swedish island of Gotland.\n\nHis favourite technique is to showcase familiar objects in the strange, other-worldly setting of the deep.\n\n\u201cIt may be a door handle, a vase or a binocular, furniture or a wall with a tool that hangs neatly left on the wall. It is so I like it, untouched, to get the best pictures,\u201d he says.\n\nWreck sites like the SS Thistlegorm, one of the world\u2019s best-known wrecks, are among his favourite to photograph, as the area\u2019s diverse marine life and beautiful corals make rich, wide-angle photography subjects.\n\nNyberg\u2019s most startling experience, though, was not one he managed to capture on camera.\n\nHe and his wife were diving SS President Coolidge, which sank in 1942 off the island Esparto Santo, Vanuatu, when the cargo rooms became flooded with blue flashing lights.\n\n\u201cSlowly we were totally surrounded by this glitter and I became completely disorientated,\u201d he says.\n\nThe peculiar blue lights turned out to be the biolumiscent eyes of a school of fish. The phenomenon \u2013 thought to attract or illuminate prey \u2013 can only be seen in total darkness, so turning on a torch would have stopped the effect.\n\nNyberg\u2019s advice for getting the perfect underwater shot is to master your diving and camera equipment before going into the water. For safety it is important to use a line to follow out, in case visibility is poor.\n\nDiving on wrecks is both exciting and physically and mentally demanding, but it can also be \u201ca form of meditation, to relax from the stress of everyday life and work\u201d.\n\nPhotographer, designer, and author, Jennifer Idol is the first woman to dive 50 states in her native US.\n\n\u201cI particularly enjoy large intact wrecks that are historic and not artificial reefs. Each wreck tells a story,\u201d Idol says.\n\nWreck diving etiquette 1. Respect War Graves\n\nTreat wrecks with the respect you would give a churchyard. 2. Respect the Wreck Environment\n\nTreat them with the care you would give to coral reefs. 3. Respect the Future\n\nTake photos rather than souvenirs. 4. Respect Our History\n\nIf you find anything, report it to the Receiver of Wreck. 5. Respect Yourself\n\nMake sure that you are appropriately trained for safe wreck diving. 6. Respect Your Family and Friends\n\nSome wrecks contain dangerous cargoes or live munitions \u2013 don't disturb them. 7. Respect the Law\n\nKnow and respect maritime laws \u2013 and avoid a criminal record.

Using models in an image helps show the scale of a wreck.\u201d\n\nCreating a powerful image takes planning. Idol says it is important photographers consider \u201corientation, condition, and depth\u201d before a shoot.\n\n\u201cA ship can be too large to see on one dive, especially when setting up a photo. Usually, descent lines are set in place or boats are moored to a line from which you follow to the wreck.\n\n\u201cIf you are creating images inside the wreck, it is important to first become familiar with the wreck and then also to follow necessary diving procedures for penetration. This may include setting lines or diving mixed gases and using redundant diving systems.\u201d\n\nEven to someone as experienced as Idol, wrecks can yield surprises.\n\n\u201cI am sometimes surprised to find schools of fish, invertebrates, and even eels deep inside wrecks,\u201d she says. \u201cThe life inside a wreck is surprising because it feels remote, is dark, and evades currents.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is very nice\u2026to see how the sea makes from a huge piece of steel a new house for fishes\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very special to feel you are in a place where some years ago there was people cruising the seas on it. I can imagine a lot of stories about it,\u201d says Jordi Benitez, a banker from Spain who started in underwater photography 12 years ago.\n\n\u201cIt is very nice too, to see how the sea makes from a huge piece of steel a new house for fishes, and how a new ecosystem is created around the wreck.\u201d\n\nBenitez\u2019 subjects have included the Dragonera in Tarragona \u2013 a large ship sunk in the 1990s as an underwater tourism attraction \u2013 and in the Red Sea the Chrisoula K and Thistlegorm. The former is a cargo ship that struck a reef and sank in the 1980s, and the latter a British wartime ship that was attacked and sunk in 1941, killing nine people. The Thistlegorm wreck was discovered in the 1950s.\n\n\u201cI love to dive in the SS Thistlegorm because there are still a lot of materials from WW2,\u201d says Benitez. \u201cYou can see bikes, trucks, trains, wings of planes... You feel as [though] you were travelling 70 years back.\u201d\n\nHis advice for capturing effective underwater photographs is to use a \u201cvery wide-angle lens\u201d and to \u201cplay with the light\u201d.\n\n\u201cIn underwater photography, we use many times strobes and artificial light, but in wrecks, it\u2019s very nice to play with natural light, this gives also a special atmosphere to the pictures.\u201d\n\nFor more incredible ocean stories, follow OurBluePlanet on Twitter.

Maelezo ya dhamira\n\nMara kwa mara, utaombwa kuwasilisha taarifa zako za kibinafsi (kwa mfano, jina na anuani ya email, nk) ili kupata au kutumia huduma zilizopo kwenye mtandao wetu. Huduma hizo ni pamoja na vijarida, mashindano, \u201cBatilisha Email\u201d, mazungumzo ya moja kwa moja, ubao wa ujumbe na uanachama BBCi.\n\nKwa kuandika maelezo yako kwenye nafasi zilizopo, unairuhusu BBC na mashirika yake yanayotoa huduma kukupatia huduma ulizoziomba. Kila unapotoa maelezo yako ya kibinafsi, tutahifadhi taarifa hizo kwa kuzingatia sera hii. Huduma zetu zimekusudiwa kukupatia taarifa unazotaka kupata. BBC itashughulika kulingana na sheria za sasa hivi na itadhamiria kutekeleza taratibu nzuri kabisa za sasa hivi za Internet.\n\n2. Tarifa za wageni\n\nWakati wowote unapotembelea mtandao wa BBCi, kurasa unazoziona, pamoja na kitu kinachoitwa cookie, zinaingizwa kwenye kompyuta yako (angalia kipengee cha 3 kupata mengi juu ya hili). Karibu kurasa zote, kama siyo zote kabisa, zinafanya hivyo, kwa sababu cookies zinaiwezesha kampuni inayomiliki kurasa hizo kufanya vitu vingi vyenye manufaa, kama vile kujua kama kompyuta hiyo (na huenda mtumiaji wake) ametembelea ukurasa huo hapo awali. Hii inafanyika wakati mtumiaji huyo anarejea tena kwenye mtandao, kwa kuchunguza ili kuangalia na kuikuta cookie iliyoachwa hapo nyuma, wakati mtumiaji alipozuru mtandao mara ya mwisho.\n\nTaarifa yoyote ambayo imetolewa na cookies inaweza kutusaidia kukupa wewe huduma bora na kutusaidia kuchunguza wasifa wa wageni wetu. Kwa mfano: kama ulipotembelea kurasa zetu mara ya mwisho, tuseme uliingia kwenye kurasa za elimu, basi tunaweza kukuta taarifa hizi kwenye cookie yako na kielelezo cha taarifa za elimu utakapoingia mara ya pili\n\nRedSheriff, kampuni ya vipimo na utafiti, inakusanya data ambazo siyo za kibinafsi zinazowahusu wageni wanaozuru kurasa zetu kwa niaba yetu kwa kutumia cookies na alama ambayo imewekwa kwenye mtandao wetu. Cookies hizo na alama iliyopo kwenye mtandao vinatoa takwimu ambazo siyo za kibinafsi kuhusu ziara zilizofanywa kwenye kurasa zetu, muda uliotumika kuangalia ukurasa, njia zilizotumiwa na wageni hao kwenye mtandao, data zilizopo kwenye mipangilio ya skrini za wageni na taarifa nyingine za kawaida. BBC inatumia taarifa kama hizi, na zile zilizopatikana kwenye cookies nyingine zilizotumika kwenye mtandao huo kusaidia kuboresha huduma kwa watumiaji wake.\n\nKama unataka kuikataa cookie ya RedSheriff's, unaweza kutumia utaratibu uliowekwa hapo chini katika kipengee cha 7. Kuilemaza (kuiondoa) alama iliyowekwa kwenye mtandao, unapaswa kupeleka maombi yako moja kwa moja kwa privacy@redsheriff.com. Taarifa nyingine zaidi kuhusu taarifa za faragha za RedSheriff's yanaweza kupatikana katika http://www.redsheriff.com/6.0.0.htm.\n\n3. Cookie ni nini?\n\nUnapoingia kwenye mtandao kompyuta yako mara moja itapewa cookie. Cookies ni faili za maandishi zinazoitambulisha kompyuta yako kwa mtambo wetu wa mtandao unaohifahdi kumbukumbu zote (server). Cookies zenyewe hazimtambui mtumiaji, ila tu zinaitambua kompyuta iliyotumiwa. Makampuni mengi ya mtandao yanafanya hivyo wakati mtumiaji anapozuru kurasa zao ili kuweza kujua jinsi watu wanavyoingia na kutoka kwenye mtandao huo.\n\nCookies zeneywe zinachukua kumbukumbu za maeneo ya mtandao ambayo yametembelewa na kompyuta husika, na kwa muda gani. Watumiaji wanapata fursa ya kuzifanya kompyuta kuruhusu cookies zote, kuwafahamisha wakati ambapo cookie imetolewa, au kutopokea cookies wakati wowote ule. Hilila mwisho linamaanisha kwamba huduma fulani fulani za kibinafsi hazitaweza kutolewa kwa mtumiaji huyo.\n\nNB: Hata kama hujaiweka kompyuta yako katika hali ya kuzikataa cookies, bado unaweza kusomasoma kwenye mtandao wetu bila kuandika jina lako, hadi hapo utakapojisalisha kutumia huduma za BBCi.\n\n4. Matumizi na hifadhi ya taarifa zako za kibinafsi\n\nUnapotoa taarifa zozote za kibinafsi kwa BBCi (kwa mfano, kwa ajili ya mashindano, huduma za jamii za BBCi (BBCi Community) au uanachama wa BBCi kisheria tunawajibika kwako katika kuangalia jinsi tunavyotumia data hizo. Tunapaswa kukusanya taarifa hizo kwa haki, hii inamaanisha kwamba tunalazimika kukuelezea jinsi tutakavyotumia data hizo (angalia matangazo kwenye kurasa husika ambazo zinakufahamisha kwa nini tunaomba maelezo hayo) na kukuambia kama tunataka upeleke taarifa hizo kwa mtu mwingine yeyote yule. Kwa kawaida, taarifa zozote zile unazozitoa kwa BBC zitatumika ndani ya BBC na watu wake wanaotoa huduma. Kamwe hazitapelekwa kwa mtu eyote yule nje yya shirika la BBC bila kupata idhini yako kwanza, isipokuwa tunapowajibika au tunaporuhusiwa kisheria kufichua taarifa hizo. Vile vile, kama unatuma au kupeleka maelezo yenye matusi au yasiyofaa juu ya BBCi au kwa BBCi na kama BBC itaona kwamba mwenendo huo ni mbaya na/au umerudiwa, BBC inaweza kutumia taarifa zozote zile zilizopatikana kuhusiana na wewe ili kukomesha mwenendo huo. Hii ni pamoja na kuwafahamisha watu wengine kama vile mwajiri wako, shule yako au kampuni inayotoa huduma za barua-pepe kuhusu yaliyomo kwenye maandishi yako au juu ya mwenendo wako.\n\nTutahifadhi taarifa zako za kibinafsi katika mitambo yetu katika muda wote ule ambao unatumia huduma yetu uliyoiomba, na tunaweza kuziondoa wakati lengo litakapotekelezwa, ama kwa upande wa uanachama wa BBCi utakapoamua kwamba hutaki tena kuendeleza usajili wako kama mwanachama wa BBCi. Hata hivyo kwa sababu za kiusalama, BBC inaweza kuhifadhi data za maandishi ya ujumbe (ikiwa ni pamoja na yaliyomo kwenye ujumbe, majina na wanachama, muda na tarehe) zilizotokana na matumizi ya huduma za jamii za BBCi (BBCi Community) kama vile Connector kwa muda wa miezi sita. Mahali ambako taarifa za kibinafsi zimehifadhiwa kwa ajili ya watu ambao bado hawajasajiliwa, lakini wameshiriki katika huduma nyingine za BBCi (kwa mfano vile mashindano), taarifa hizo zitahifahdiwa kwa kipindi kitakachoonekana kwamba kinafaa ili kuhakikisha kwamba huduma hizo zinaendeshwa vizuri. Tutahakikisha kwamba taarifa za kibinafsi zilizotolewa zinahifadhiwa vizuri katika hali ya usalama, kulingana na Sheria ya Kulinda Data ya mwaka 1998 (Data Protection Act 1998).\n\nKama umearifiwa kwenye mtandao wa BBCi kwamba taarifa zako zinaweza kutumiwa kuiwezesha BBC kuwasiliana na wewe kwa ajili ya \u201chuduma za kiutawala\u201d, hii inamaanisha kwamba BBC inaweza kuwasiliana na wewe kwa sababu kadhaa zinazohusiana na huduma uliyojiandikisha nayo. Kwa mfano, tunaweza kukupatia huduma ya kukukumbusha juu ya password yako au kukujulisha kwamba huduma husika imesimamishwa kwa matengenezo. Hatutawasiliana na wewe kwa ajili ya kutoa matangazo, kama vile kukujulisha juu ya kuboresha huduma zetu au juu ya vipindi vipya vya BBCi, isipokuwa kama unakubali bayana kwamba tuwasiliane nawe kwa malengo kama hayo wakati unapowasilisha taarifa zako kwenye mtandao, au baadaye kama utajiandikisha kwa madhumuni mahsusi ya kupokea taarifa kama hizo za matangazo.\n\n5. Kupata taarifa zako za kibinafsi - Access to your personal information\n\nUna haki ya kuomba nakala ya taarifa zako za kibinafsi zinazokuhusu ambazo BBC inazihifadhi na kusahihisha maelezo yoyote yenye makosa. (Tunatoza \u00a310 (paundi 10) kwa maombi ya taarifa hizo.) Tafadhali peleka maombi yote kwa Data Protection Officer, BBC Regulatory Legal Department, Room 3637, White City, London W12 7TS (Email: dpa.officer@bbc.co.uk).\n\n6. Watumiaji wenye umri wa miaka 16 au pungufu\n\nKama una umri wa miaka 16 au miaka pungufu ya hapo, tafadhali pata idhini kutoka kwa mzazi/mlezi wako wakati wote unapotaka kutoa maelezo yako ya kwenye mtandao wa BBC. Watumiaji ambao hawana idhini ya aina hiyo hawaruhusiwi kutupatia taarifa zao za kibinafsi.\n\n7.

Temporary usage bans, such as hose-pipe bans would be prepared. They need to be approved by Natural Resources Wales.\n\nDrought: Temporary usage bans brought in - as the public is urged to conserve supplies.\n\nSevere Drought: Non-essential water use bans introduced. The public asked to \"think carefully about the water you use\". As a last resort, Drought Orders restricting supplies could be introduced.\n\nWelsh Water, a not-for-profit firm, has insisted it is a long way from where Wales was back in 1976, when a drought saw dry reservoirs.\n\nIt is pumping an extra one billion litres of water a day from reservoirs into its system to meet hot weather demands.\n\nImage copyright Keystone/Getty Images Image caption Residents look out at the Pontsticill Reservoir between Powys and Merthyr Tydfil in 1976\n\nManaging director Peter Perry, said: \"The water levels in our reservoirs is around where we would expect for the time of year and under current conditions we and we don't have concerns about the water levels across the area we serve.\n\n\"But customers are obviously using much more water in this hot weather and so we need to ensure that we can get the water to customers. Our staff are working day and night to help spot and repair leaks and using tankers to put extra water into the network.\n\n\"We always ask customers to work with us. If they spot a leak, please let us know and be mindful of how much water they are using. While encouraging everyone to stay safe and drink water while it's hot, we should always avoid wasting water so that we can manage the demand for everyone.\"\n\nImage caption Water levels on the river Teifi at Cenarth appear to be low\n\nNatural Resources Wales' water manager Natalie Hall told BBC Radio Wales that some river levels would also become a cause for concern for fish and wildlife, if the heatwave continues.\n\n\"They are not at record low levels at the moment, but were already seeing some low levels with risk to fish,\" she said.\n\nShe said the Welsh Government environment body was enforcing licence limits on the amount of water taken out of rivers, and was constantly monitoring the situation.\n\n\"We are doing everything we can - obviously it is a natural event and the environment can respond to situations like this,\" she added.\n\n\"I'd encourage people to start just thinking about the water they use - it is always sensible to use water efficiently.\"", "authors": [], "url": "http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-wales-44771694"}, {"title": "BBC News Gahuza", "text": "", "authors": [], "url": "http://www.bbc.com/gahuza/media/audio"}, {"title": "BBC News Gahuza", "text": "", "authors": [], "url": "http://www.bbc.com/gahuza/media/video"}, {"title": "Gahunda za radio n'imirongo ivugiraho", "text": "", "authors": [], "url": "http://www.bbc.com/gahuza/ibindi_wifashisha/2010/10/101005_schedules_gahuza"}, {"title": "Abo dukorana mu karere", "text": "", "authors": [], "url": "http://www.bbc.com/gahuza/ibindi_wifashisha/2013/05/130524_bbcgahuza_partners"}, {"title": "Tumenyeshe ibyo utishimira", "text": "", "authors": [], "url": "http://www.bbc.com/gahuza/ibindi_wifashisha/2015/08/000000_complaints"}, {"title": "Amategeko n'ingingo", "text": "", "authors": [], "url": "http://www.bbc.com/gahuza/ibindi_wifashisha/2010/10/101001_mobile_t_and_c_gahuza"}, {"title": "Turi bande", "text": "", "authors": [], "url": "http://www.bbc.com/gahuza/ibindi_wifashisha/2010/10/101005_about_us_gahuza"}, {"title": "Ubuzima bwite", "text": "", "authors": [], "url": "http://www.bbc.com/gahuza/ibindi_wifashisha/2010/10/100930_privacy_gahuza"}, {"title": "Vugana natwe", "text": "", "authors": [], "url": "http://www.bbc.com/gahuza/ibindi_wifashisha/2010/10/101005_contact_us_gahuza"}, {"title": "BBC Internet Blog: News Connected Studio", "text": "Hi I am the head of product for BBC News Online and lead the product strategy and development of website, mobile, tablet and IPTV products for News.\n\n\n\nThe change of year is a good time to look back and also forward.

Curated by Hereford Museum and Art Gallery, this vivid experience shows his tragic artistic journey from innocence to bitter realism.\n\nThe story is one of a series of interactive timelines created as part of the Civilisations Festival, which is an exciting collaboration between the BBC and museums, galleries, libraries and archives across the UK.\n\nWhy have we created these stories for you?\n\nOur team is called Rewind and we make new things from the BBC\u2019s vast archive and experiment with new tools and formats. We recently got the opportunity to work with museums and galleries as part of the Civilisations Festival, and they've helped us make use of our new storytelling tool \u2013 Canvas.

The guiding principles by which you live your life. These are then contextualised with information about how they relate to others and why they matter - with people invited to share and compare their results.\n\nHow was it created?\n\n\n\nFor the Tomorrow's World campaign, I became interested in why people cared about some aspects of science & technology but not others. I wanted to know why people would prioritise some improvements in society over other ones. Speaking to researchers at the Cathie Marsh Institute at Manchester University, I became aware of the Theory of Basic Human Values, and thought this might be an interesting way for to examine one's motivations for the way we live our lives. One researcher who has used these instruments to understand things like fake news, attitude to vaccination and climate change is Sander van der Linden at Cambridge University. He helped me develop the project greatly.\n\nOnce we had the scientific basis, we worked with Roll Studio to develop a format that would be simple and enjoyable to complete. Having established the need to visualise values in an engaging and comparable way - we settled on the idea of the \u2018Flower\u2019 visual that builds up as questions are answered. That then became the core aesthetic throughout - and the way by which we could encourage and make clear the various comparisons we were trying to make\n\nWhat challenges did you face?\n\nVisualising something as abstract as values was difficult - so we tried to find something that was beautiful but also conveyed some of the core information we were able to pull out like dominant values and how the \u2018groupings\u2019 can identify broader types.\n\nIt was also a challenge turning a questionnaire designed for science into something more engaging. It was vital the integrity was maintained, so instead we looked at bringing in some \u2018delight\u2019 in the UX - the input methods and the visuals to help draw a user through the experience.\n\nWhat do you hope to learn from it being on Taster?\n\n\n\nWe want to establish audience appetite for this type of approach, but also engagement with this complex topic. We will know we have succeeded if we see lots of people going through the full question set - and also if they go on to share and compare their individual results\n\nWhat next?\n\n\n\nThis is just one part of a wider experience - so we hope this project sparks a wider interest in the subject matter that can be further explored and satisfied by some of the other projects being developed to go alongside.", "authors": [], "url": "http://www.bbc.com/taster/pilots/global-values-where-do-you-fit"}, {"title": "The Next Step - 6 days to go", "text": "Oops you can't see this activity!\n\nTo enjoy

They had spent nine days in the cave with little food or light when they were discovered on Monday 2 July.\n\nImage copyright AFP/Royal Thai Navy\n\nRescuers initially wanted to keep the group supplied underground until the end of the rainy season - which would have taken months.\n\nBut with the forecast of heavy rains, and the risk of water levels rising, an operation was launched on Sunday, 8 July, to bring them out.\n\nHow did the boys escape?\n\nRescue divers with specialist breathing equipment reached the group through a series of water-filled passages.\n\nThe boys had to be brought out the same way.\n\nTwo divers accompanied each boy, one holding the boy close under his body and the other diver following behind. The divers guided them through the dark using ropes.\n\nIn narrow sections, rescuers had to take off their air tanks and squeeze the boys and the tanks through.\n\nThe boys were given anti-anxiety medication to prevent them panicking as they were brought out.\n\nEach boy was given a full face mask - thought to be easier to use for novice divers.\n\nImage copyright AFP Image caption Full-face masks are easier for beginners because they do not rely on a mouthpiece\n\nThe diving option was considered extremely dangerous by some, but British dive experts said the priority was to get the boys out before the rains brought more flooding and debris into the cave system.\n\nMartin Grass, Chairman of the Cave Diving Group, said the rescuers would probably instruct the boys not to hold their breath, to use their fins slowly and breathe gently.\n\nHe said the boys would have two divers each chaperoning them, \"to make sure they don't panic\".\n\n\"It could be a bonus that the boys are young. When you're young, you feel invincible and they'd see it as a bit of an adventure,\" he said.\n\nImage copyright Thai Navy Seals Image caption Most cave divers dive with air tanks to the side of them. The Thai Navy Seals wear them on their backs\n\nIt is thought the boys spent 10 to 15 minutes under water at a time, depending how much of the passageways were flooded. Each journey back to the entrance, which also involved walking and scrambling through narrow spaces, took hours.\n\nThe rescue mission started on 8 July, with divers entering the cave at 10:00 local time (03:00 GMT). The first boy emerged at 17:40 and by 19:47, three more had followed.\n\nAll four were taken to hospital. The mission was paused overnight for air tanks to be replaced along the route but resumed again on Monday when four more boys were brought out.\n\nThe pumping continued to try to reduce the flooding, and Chiang Rai provincial governor Narongsak Osottanakorn, who was leading the operation, said that water levels inside were now at their lowest levels so far. This was reported to have made more sections walkable than earlier in the week.\n\nDivers took hundreds of compressed air tanks into the cave, and established a base camp inside a chamber.\n\nThe final four boys and their coach were brought out today (Tuesday 10 July).\n\nWaiting and pumping\n\nThere was a round-the-clock pumping operation to try to clear the caves.\n\nBut as fast as the water was being pumped out, more was flowing in, fed by sinkholes and streams in the hills above, and the risks from the imminent monsoon rains was high.\n\nMr Narongsak said the mission was \"a race against the water\".\n\nImage copyright Getty Images\n\nDrilling down\n\nThe authorities did try to drill holes in the cave walls to help drain some of the flood water - although the thick rock hampered efforts.\n\nThere were also suggestions that drilling could be another way to get to the boys and lift them out.\n\nBut to even begin the process, new roads would need to be built up above the caves to accommodate the heavy drilling equipment needed to break through the rock.\n\nImage copyright EPA Image caption Authorities have tried to drill holes to let out flood waters\n\nA detailed survey of the area would also be needed - otherwise there would be little chance of digging a hole in the right place to reach the boys and their coach. Drilling could also destabilise rocks above the children or block passages and increase flooding.\n\nWhat were the dangers down there?\n\nThe boys, aged between 11 and 17, and their 25-year-old coach had been huddled on a small rock ledge. The environment was wet, so they had to keep warm and dry or risk hypothermia.\n\nThere were concerns about the level of oxygen in the air in the space where the boys were trapped. Officials said at one point that the level of oxygen in the air had fallen to 15%. The usual level is 21%.\n\nRescuers transferred about 100 oxygen tanks to the cave to help improve the air supply.\n\nThai diver PO Saman had been helping transfer the tanks when he got into difficulties on the way back and did not have enough air himself.

Mr Kavanaugh objected, saying that her right to have an abortion was \"based on a constitutional principle as novel as it is wrong\".\n\nHe did, however, write in his dissent to the ruling that the court must recognise Roe v Wade and another abortion rights case \"as precedents we must follow\".\n\nExecutive power\n\nMr Kavanaugh argued in 2009 article that presidents should be shielded from criminal investigations and civil lawsuits while in office. That could be a red flag to Democrats - indicating that if the special counsel investigation into Mr Trump's campaign ties to Russia finds its way to the Supreme Court, he would not support action against Mr Trump while the president before his term is up.\n\nGuns\n\nHe is pro-second amendment. In 2011, he objected when the DC Circuit Court upheld a ban on most semi-automatic rifles in the district. He argued that, because most handguns are semi-automatic, and are protected by a previous Supreme Court ruling, semi-automatic rifles should benefit from the same protection.\n\nThe environment\n\nThe nomination is likely to concern environmentalists. Mr Kavanaugh has issued rulings and dissents against Obama-era environmental regulations, including efforts to curb air pollution from power plants and greenhouse gases.\n\nWhat's at stake?\n\nThe US Supreme Court is the ultimate arbiter on contentious laws and disputes between states and the federal government.\n\nIt rules on such issues as abortion, the death penalty, voter rights, immigration policy, campaign finance and racial bias in policing.\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Explaining Roe v Wade and abortion in US\n\nEach of the nine justices holds a lifetime appointment.

How can that be the case?\n\nThat workers with six-figure salaries could be considered \"poor\" is something that might surprise many people.\n\nBut taking into account income and housing costs that is the reality for some families - who may be eligible for housing assistance - according to a recent report from the US Department of Housing and Urban Development.\n\nIn San Francisco and nearby San Mateo and Marin Counties it said $117,400 for a family of four was \"low income\", while $73,300 (\u00a354,900) was \"very low income\" - the highest figures anywhere in the country.\n\nA look at how earnings vary across the US and between jobs illustrates what is going in the city and the country as a whole - factors explored by a new study and interactive website by The Hamilton Project at the Brookings Institution.\n\nBelow the poverty line\n\nImage copyright Getty Images\n\nNearly two thirds of American families of four live on less than San Francisco's \"low-income\" threshold of $117,400.\n\nAcross the US, the median (middle) household income for a family of four is $91,000 (\u00a368,170). For a family of any size, the figure is $59,000 (\u00a344,180). (Median incomes are used throughout this piece).\n\nAnd, in a country of 326m, more than 40m people in families of all sizes live below the poverty line, which is $25,100 (\u00a318,800) for a family of four.\n\nLooking at all jobs, earnings are much higher in some large cities than they are in the rest of the country.\n\nSan Francisco in particular stands out.\n\nThe city has become a hub for IT and other high-tech industry - leading to an economic boom which has seen it become home to many of the country's highest-paid workers.\n\nBetween 2008 and 2016, individual earnings for full-time workers aged 25 to 64 in the San Francisco metro area, which also includes Alameda and Contra Costa counties, grew by 26% - far faster than in many other large metro areas. By 2016, earnings had risen to $63,000 (\u00a347,200)\n\nOf course, there are other areas of the US with high wages.\n\nAmong 25 to 64-year-olds, typical earnings for full-time workers in recent years were $65,000 (\u00a348,670) in San Jose, $60,600 (\u00a345,400) in Washington DC and $55,700 (\u00a341,700) in Boston.\n\nIn high-earning places like these there are many jobs that pay well.\n\nIn San Francisco, doctors - the highest-paid occupation - can expect to earn $193,400 (\u00a3144,800). The typical chief executive or public administrator is paid $167,300 (\u00a3125,260), while software developers can expect $117,100 (\u00a387,670).\n\nBut there are plenty of people earning much less.\n\nThe lowest-paid people in San Francisco are farm workers, who typically earn $18,500 (\u00a313,850), while childcare workers earn $22,300 (\u00a316,700).\n\nWages in other big US cities are noticeably lower.\n\nIn Detroit, for example, a doctor typically earns $144,300 (\u00a3108,000), while childcare workers receive only $15,000 (\u00a311,230).\n\nHowever, the wide variation in earnings is only part of the equation.\n\nLiving costs, particularly for housing, play a significant role in determining how far workers can stretch their earnings.\n\nIn fact, living costs in general for the San Francisco area are 25% higher than the national average.\n\nHowever, as earnings are 45% higher than for the nation as a whole, many people in San Francisco are still coming out ahead.\n\nMore like this\n\nIt is when we look at housing costs specifically that the comparison is less favourable.\n\nIn many large cities, the problems of high rents and home prices have been exacerbated by strict building rules and growing income inequality.\n\nIt is high rents in San Francisco that are behind the decision to label some six-figure earning families as \"low income\".\n\nFor example, a fair market rent for a two-bedroom apartment in the San Francisco area is considered to be $3,121 (\u00a32,340) per month - nearly twice the 2008 figure of $1,592 (\u00a31,190). In Cincinnati, Ohio, the figure is $845 (\u00a3632). This difference (270%) is much larger than the difference in median family incomes (50%).\n\nImage copyright Getty Images\n\nAs such, affordability is a significant challenge for many people in San Francisco.\n\nAcross the US, the government typically defines a low-income family as one that earns less than 80% of the median income for families of the same size, in the same area.\n\nBut in places with unusually high housing costs the threshold can be higher.\n\nIn San Francisco, high rents have driven the government's \"low income\" threshold of $117,400 (\u00a387,970) almost as high as the median income for a family of four in the area - $118,400 (\u00a388,630).\n\nWhile falling below this mark does not automatically entitle families to government housing assistance such as subsidies and public housing, it is a factor that is considered.\n\nMore important than money\n\nBut it is of course worth considering that, for many people, high prices are something that they are willing to put up with for a good quality of life.\n\nSan Francisco is certainly an expensive place to live, but good weather and a rich cultural life attract many residents.\n\nAcross the US, it is often the case that the places rated most highly for quality of life - like San Francisco and Santa Barbara in California and Honolulu in Hawaii - tend to have a high cost of living.\n\nWhile families with six-figure earnings may not be \"low-income\" in the broadest sense, the challenge remains for expensive cities across the US to find ways to offer a good quality of life to all of their residents.\n\nA critical look at how to make more affordable housing available might be an obvious place to start.\n\nAbout this piece\n\nThis analysis piece was commissioned by the BBC from experts working for an outside organisation.\n\nProf Jay Shambaugh is the director of The Hamilton Project and a senior fellow in Economic Studies at the Brookings Institution.\n\nRyan Nunn is the policy director of The Hamilton Project and a fellow in Economic Studies at the Brookings Institution.\n\nThe Brookings Institution is a not-for-profit public policy organisation, conducting research that leads to new ideas for solving problems facing society.", "authors": ["Ryan Nunn", "Jay Shambaugh", "The Hamilton Project", "Brookings Institution"], "url": "http://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-44725026"}, {"title": "Trump: What does the US do for the Nato alliance in Europe?", "text": "Image copyright AFP Image caption US forces take part regularly in Nato exercises\n\nPresident Trump says the US is being \"taken advantage of\" by other members of the Nato alliance, which was set up in 1949 to counter the Soviet Union.\n\nShortly before leaving for the Nato summit, he said other members should increase their financial contributions.\n\nBut the President of the European Council, Donald Tusk, hit back by saying that the US had no better ally than Europe.\n\nSkip Twitter post by @eucopresident Dear @realDonaldTrump.

He has a proclivity for conspiracy theories and appoints his daughter to a key White House role.\n\nBut the year isn't 2016.\n\nIt's 1850.\n\nIt's not Donald Trump.\n\nIt's Millard Fillmore, whose sheer anonymity has made him an in-joke among presidential history fans.\n\nInstead of Muslim or Central American refugees, it's Germans and Irish Catholics.\n\nMr Trump prefers to liken himself to Andrew Jackson, the seventh US president.\n\nAnd there are similarities between the two.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption Fillmore launched his career on the back of a conspiracy theory\n\nBoth were populist outsiders who were dismissed as unfit to govern by an out-of-touch Washington elite.\n\nHowever, Jackson was a Democrat and a war hero who defeated the British at the Battle of New Orleans.\n\nIt's difficult to imagine Old Hickory, as he was known, excusing himself from military duty on the grounds that he could not march long distances, as Mr Trump did during the Vietnam War, citing bone spurs.\n\nThe parallels between the 45th president and the 13th - unlucky for some - are arguably more compelling.\n\nFillmore launched his career in the 1820s with the Anti-Masonic Party, hawking a paranoid rumour that ruling Freemasons were murdering whistleblowers.\n\nMr Trump paved the way for his White House bid by peddling a conspiracy theory, too - that President Barack Obama was not a US citizen.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption Millard was initially vice-president to Zachary Taylor (L)\n\nFillmore later joined the Whig Party at a time of mounting hostility to refugees from famine, rebellion and tyranny who were arriving by the shipload at the gates of the New World.\n\nDemocrats embraced these predominantly Catholic huddled masses as a new voting bloc.\n\nBut as his biographer Robert Rayback writes, Fillmore shared the fear of some other top Whigs that the incoming papist hordes would plot to subvert America's sovereignty.\n\nWhen Millard lost his race for New York governor in 1844, he blamed \"foreign Catholics\".\n\nImmigrant voters were \"corrupting the ballot box - that great palladium of our liberty - into an unmeaning mockery\", he fumed.\n\nCompare this with Mr Trump's unfounded claim that millions of illegal immigrants cast votes in the last White House election.\n\nThere's also a familiar ring to Fillmore's gripe about American jobs being taken by \"men of foreign birth to the exclusion of the native born\".\n\nMillard became vice-president to Zachary Taylor in 1849 and, following Old Rough and Ready's untimely demise a year later, an accidental president.\n\nFillmore biographer Paul Finkelman, who is president of Gratz College in Greater Philadelphia, says: \"When Fillmore comes into office, the first thing he does is to literally fire his whole cabinet.\n\n\"Donald Trump has had more cabinet turnover than any other president probably since Millard Fillmore.\n\n\"The Fillmore administration was in constant turmoil because you didn't know who was running things from one day to the next, and that's precisely the same situation with Trump. It's government by chaos.\"\n\nMillard's daughter, Abby, became White House hostess, a position as high-profile as Ivanka Trump's. First Lady Abigail Fillmore was an introvert who largely shunned social functions - not dissimilar to Melania Trump.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption Abigail Powers Fillmore and Melania Trump\n\nThis president's undoing was his support for the Compromise of 1850, a pact between slave states and free states that was a signpost to the US Civil War. His stance on the toxic debate angered African-Americans.\n\nDr Finkelman's biography notes that one Ohio preacher said: \"Would not the devil do well to rent out hell and move to the United States and rival if possible, President Fillmore and his political followers?\"\n\nMany black leaders and their allies today sound no less scathing of Mr Trump.\n\nIn a humiliating snub, Fillmore was denied his party's nomination in 1852. He quit the Whigs to lead the virulently anti-immigrant, anti-Catholic American Party.\n\nDubbed the Know Nothings, they openly fomented ethnic and racial bigotry, culminating in 1855 with Bloody Monday, when Protestant mobs attacked German and Irish neighbourhoods in Louisville, Kentucky, leaving at least 22 people dead.\n\nAt the elections a year later, the American Party carried just one state: Maryland - ironic, considering it had been founded as a sanctuary colony for English Catholics.\n\nPolitically, Fillmore was no more.\n\nMore on US presidents\n\nThe Whigs never recovered from his presidency. And out of their ashes rose the Republican Party led by Abraham Lincoln.\n\nJoan Cashin, professor of history at Ohio State University, points out there are differences between Trump and Fillmore, not least that the latter grew up in rural poverty and was regarded as a polite, bland politician.\n\nTrump was the playboy son of a real estate millionaire - Fillmore was an indentured child apprentice in a textile mill.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption The early home of Fillmore in New Hope, Cayuga County, New York\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption Trump's childhood home in Queens, New York City\n\nBut Prof Cashin draws a distinct link between mid-19th Century prejudices and today.\n\n\"The notion that native-born white Anglo-Saxon Protestants are supposed to be in charge,\" she says, \"that they decide who's allowed to come here, that's a parallel.\n\n\"Except for Native Americans, we're all immigrants to one degree or another in this country.\n\n\"I think it was Martin Luther King who said, 'we may have come here in different ships, but we're all in the same boat now.'\"\n\nA postscript: Millard was held to be strikingly good looking. Queen Victoria reputedly praised him as the handsomest man she had ever met.\n\nSome people see an uncanny resemblance between Fillmore and the actor Alec Baldwin.\n\nBaldwin, of course, plays Mr Trump on the comedy show Saturday Night Live.\n\nThe 13th president has faded in popular memory to little more than a trivia question. His Know Nothings are a warning from the past. And it is decades since the Millard Fillmore Society was last heard of.\n\nAccording to research, barely 8% of US college students are even aware who he was.\n\nIf Mr Trump finds himself on the wrong side of history, he could one day be cruelly forgotten, too.\n\nGiven America's enduring disunity, a prayer once uttered by Fillmore still seems to resonate: \"May God save the country, for it is evident that the people will not.\"", "authors": ["Jude Sheerin", "Bbc News", "Washington"], "url": "http://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-44688337"}, {"title": "Two days in an underwater cave running out of oxygen", "text": "Image copyright Toni Cirer\n\nThree months ago, Xisco Gr\u00e0cia experienced what he describes as every diver's worst nightmare - he found himself in an underwater cave, relying on an air pocket for survival. As hours turned into days he realised he might not be found in time.\n\nOn Saturday 15 April, Xisco Gr\u00e0cia slipped into the water in Mallorca for a routine dive. The geology teacher spent most weekends exploring and mapping the island's complex system of underwater caves.\n\n\"Mallorca is much more beautiful underground than above ground,\" he says.\n\nImage copyright Pere Gamundi Image caption Xisco Gr\u00e0cia, pictured carrying four tanks of air which last for an hour each\n\nHe and his dive buddy, Guillem Mascar\u00f3, wanted to explore Sa Piqueta, a cave with numerous chambers 1km from the entrance of the labyrinth. They swam underwater for an hour to get there.\n\nWhile Gr\u00e0cia spent time collecting rock samples, Mascar\u00f3 swam off to chart a nearby chamber.\n\nIt was as they headed for home that several things went wrong at once. Gr\u00e0cia met Mascar\u00f3 by chance at a junction, and they stirred up silt from the ground, making it difficult to see.\n\nImage copyright Toni Cirer Image caption Cave divers must always set up a continuous guideline to the surface\n\nThey then realised that their guideline - a narrow nylon wire which led back to the entrance - had either broken or slipped.\n\n\"The wire is for guiding purposes. It is left behind once you enter the cave and you can follow it out again afterwards,\" Gr\u00e0cia, 54, says.\n\n\"We can only guess some rocks had fallen on it. We spent a precious hour trying to find it by touch, but without success.\"\n\nBy this point the pair were in grave danger. They had consumed the air they had brought to get them in and out as well as most of their emergency air.\n\nImage copyright Toni Cirer Image caption It is easy to kick up sediment in Mallorca's underwater caves\n\nLuckily, Gr\u00e0cia remembered that other divers had talked of an air pocket in a chamber nearby. He tugged Mascar\u00f3 to it, and there they talked through their options.\n\nBoth knew they only had enough air for one of them to make it out.\n\n\"We decided I would stay and Guillem would go for help. He was skinnier than me and needed less air for breathing. I was also more experienced at breathing cave air, which has higher carbon dioxide levels,\" Gr\u00e0cia says.\n\nThey planned an alternative, longer route out on a map. Mascar\u00f3 would have to travel along some of it without a guideline and could potentially get lost.\n\n\"It would have been like trying to drive a car in a very foggy night,\" Gr\u00e0cia says.\n\n\"Guillem was reluctant to leave me on my own but we knew it was our only chance.\"\n\nImage copyright Toni Cirer Image caption The caves were flooded when sea levels rose more than 60,000 years ago\n\nOnce Mascar\u00f3 had left, Gr\u00e0cia took off most of his equipment and explored the chamber. It was about 80m (260ft) long and 20m wide, with a gap of 12m between the water and the ceiling.\n\nHe realised the water at the surface of the lake was drinkable. He also discovered a large flat rock and pulled himself out of the water to rest.\n\nGr\u00e0cia decided he would have to manage without light. Two of his three torches no longer worked and the third was low on battery.\n\n\"I only turned it on when I went to pee or to climb down to get fresh water,\" he says.\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Listen: Xisco Gr\u00e0cia describes how the troubles began, on Outlook, on the BBC World Service\n\nThere was little he could do now but wait, in complete darkness, and hope to be rescued.\n\n\"I asked myself why this had happened to me now after so many years of diving,\" Gr\u00e0cia says.\n\n\"But I was hopeful during the first seven or eight hours as I thought Guillem would make it out. As time passed, though, I started to lose hope. I thought, 'Guillem has got lost and died and no-one knows I am down here.'\"\n\nGr\u00e0cia began to think about his loved ones above ground.\n\n\"I have two children, a son of 15 and a daughter of nine. I thought about how they were too young to lose their father and what would happen to them,\" he says.\n\nAlthough he managed to remain calm, he began experiencing the effects of breathing in high levels of carbon dioxide. While the air we breathe above ground is 0.04% carbon dioxide, in the cave the level was as high as 5%.\n\n\"I had a headache and although I was exhausted through lack of oxygen it was impossible to sleep. My brain was whirring,\" he says.\n\nImage copyright Toni Cirer Image caption It is easy to become disorientated in Mallorca's submerged caves\n\nHis mind began playing tricks on him.\n\n\"I got the feeling there were lights in the lake and I heard the sound of bubbles of a diver emerging.\n\n\"But when I turned my head I saw nothing. It was a hallucination.\"\n\nGr\u00e0cia lost track of time but after what felt like days he heard a loud noise above him. He realised Mascar\u00f3 must have made it out.\n\n\"I thought at first I could hear the sound of tanks being filled with air for the rescue team.

I wanted to have it as a last resort if I needed to choose whether to die quickly or slowly.\"\n\nShortly after this Gr\u00e0cia thought he heard the sound of bubbles again.\n\n\"I looked and saw a diver's light that seemed to be getting brighter and brighter,\" he says.\n\n\"I thought it was another hallucination but then I realised it was real and I saw a helmet emerging.\"\n\nIt was Bernat Clamor, an old friend.\n\n\"I jumped in to the water and embraced him.

Finally, Clamor and fellow diver John Freddy had made it through, after waiting a day for the silt to settle.\n\nGr\u00e0cia's ordeal was still not over. Clamor had to leave him to contact the rescue team, but gave him some glucose pouches to boost his energy levels.\n\n\"It would take eight more hours to get me out of that cave, but they were eight happy hours,\" Gr\u00e0cia says.\n\nGr\u00e0cia was given air enriched with oxygen to breathe and slowly guided to the entrance. He emerged late on Monday 17 April, 60 hours after he went in. Guillem Mascar\u00f3 was there to meet him.\n\n\"We embraced but didn't have time to speak as they took me off in an ambulance.\n\n\"It hit me physically as soon as I left the water.

I was given pure oxygen to breathe overnight.\"\n\nImage copyright Twitter/@112IllesBalears Image caption Xisco Gr\u00e0cia, pictured as he emerged following his ordeal\n\nGr\u00e0cia had kept his emotions in check the whole way through his experience.\n\n\"You have to be able to control your emotions with diving. But the next day I watched coverage of the big rescue operation on TV and I cried. I was so thankful.\"\n\nGr\u00e0cia has not turned his back on diving, despite his narrow escape. A month after the incident he went back to Sa Piqueta. He has even visited the chamber where he was stuck for so long.\n\n\"I don't hold any grudges against that cave - it's not like it's the cave's fault,\" he says.\n\nGr\u00e0cia says he will continue mapping Mallorca's underwater heritage.\n\n\"My children don't like it much but they don't tell me not to do it,\" he says.\n\n\"I have spent 24 years exploring underground.

Soon you're lost in thought, so you don't see your beloved waving from across the terminal. How can she get your attention? Shouting your name would work. But if she does that, bystanders will panic. Security will circle. Your law-abiding missus could be taken to a stark side-room and interrogated for hours.\n\nWhat's the problem?\n\nYour wife is a practising Muslim, and your name is Jihad.\n\nWhat's life like when your loving parents saddle you with a name that provokes shock, rudeness or awkward jokes across much of the Western world?\n\nThe BBC asked three men named Jihad - a doctor from Chicago, a famous Syrian actor, and a young engineer from the Palestinian territories building a life in London.\n\nIn Arabic-speaking countries, Jihad - sometimes spelled Jehad - is a perfectly normal thing to call your baby. The word means \"a struggle for a noble cause\". And in the days before 9/11 and the War on Terror linked it to mass murder in the public imagination, it functioned just like any other name.\n\nFor Jihad Abdo, one of Syria's best-known actors, it was the name his millions of fans followed. The one the authorities followed. The one that got his car smashed up when he was felt to have criticised Syria's government in the LA Times.\n\nAbdo was ordered to give a TV interview in support of President Assad. He refused, and fled the country.\n\nThe US was his sanctuary - but his name quickly proved a liability.\n\n\"I raced to America in October 2011,\" Abdo explains by phone from Paris, on a break from filming the US comedy-drama Patriot. \"In no time I was introducing myself to people and seeing this\u2026 reaction\u2026\"\n\n\"Especially in the Midwest, when they heard my name was Jihad the first thing that appeared to their minds was the image of suicide bombers, and the jihadists that attack the army in Afghanistan or Iraq.\"\n\nAbdo, whose most popular TV show had an audience of 50 million, simply couldn't catch a break in Los Angeles. He suffered through 100 failed auditions and scraped by delivering pizza for Domino's.\n\nHe realised that to keep his career, he would have to lose his name.\n\nImage copyright Alamy Image caption Jihad \"Jay\" Abdo (C) starred opposite Nicole Kidman in the 2015 Hollywood drama Queen of the Desert\n\n\"I just imagine someone with the opposite thing in my country, with a name that we fear.

I love my name, but I also want to survive.\n\n\"I consider myself an open-minded guy, and my wife as well. Humbly speaking, we don't care about having this name or that name.

I've met women named Jihad. And it's not even explicitly Islamic, so there are Christians named Jihad as well.\"\n\nBut in 1970s America?

Emma Jane Kirby has been scouring the archives to find out.\n\nI've known for some time that 23-year-old Sgt Paul Meyer called his wife from the cockpit of his stolen Hercules aircraft - Jane Goodson, as she's now called, told me this herself when she spoke to me from her home in Virginia.\n\n\"Honey!\" he had told her triumphantly, waking her from a deep sleep. \"I got a bird in the sky and I'm coming home!\"\n\nWhat I didn't realise then, however, was that the last 20 minutes or so of their conversation was recorded. And when the transcript of that recording was sent to me, I will admit that I sat down and wept.\n\nBy the time the tape recorder was rolling, Meyer's jubilation and bravado had left him. The cold reality of what he'd just done - and what lay ahead - had hit him squarely.\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption The last conversation between the homesick mechanic and his wife, read by actors - from PM on BBC Radio 4\n\n\"Well, honey I'll be really honest with you,\" he admits. \"I kind of think I made a big dang wrong mistake here. I feel like the biggest dodo around here right now. Over.\"\n\nJane, clearly petrified, has to still her own nerves as she tries to reassure her panicking husband.\n\n\"You are the most wonderful thing in this whole world, you hear?\" she says. \"Honey, I'm going to bring you home, I'm going to fly you right in here, OK? Over.\"\n\nThen Meyer's commanding officer tries to cut across the line. \"Sgt Meyer! Sgt Meyer! This is Col Kingery, do you read me?\" he says. \"It's Col Kingery from Mildenhall. Over!\"\n\nAlone in the 37-tonne, four-engine transport plane he was not qualified to fly, Meyer - unsure of his direction and unsure of what he was doing - tells his wife desperately: \"Everything will be all worth it if I can just kiss your sweet lips one more time. Over.\"\n\nAnd Jane, his wife of just 55 days, promises him: \"You'll get to kiss my sweet lips until we are old and grey in the rocking chairs in Missouri. Over.\"\n\nTwenty minutes later, after Meyer has switched the plane to autopilot, the call cuts off. Meyer's final recorded words are: \"I'm doing all right, I'm doing all right, uh.\"\n\nAlthough he'd passed the USAF's \"human reliability test\" comfortably in the weeks before being posted to the UK, it's clear that Meyer had not been \"doing all right\" for some time. A Vietnam veteran, he'd been suffering from flashbacks and nightmares and - homesick and unhappy - he was reportedly drinking heavily.\n\nIn 1969, Sgt Ralph Howard Vincent, known by the nickname Sgt Mac, was serving in the 48th Air Police squadron at RAF Lakenheath, a few miles from Meyer's Mildenhall base. The first time he met Paul Meyer in a Suffolk pub, he thinks, Meyer had passed out from the amount of drink he'd consumed. He remembers banging a table to ask Meyer if he and his friends could share it with him, and Meyer, slumped across it, failed to stir.\n\nIt was only when the others bought a round that Meyer lifted his head, pushed his empty pint glass towards them and said: \"I'll let you sit here if you buy me a drink!\"\n\nSgt Mac spent two long evenings in the pub with Meyer and distinctly recalls Meyer ranting against the USAF, which he said was forcing him to work long hours away from his beloved family. He talked a lot, says Sgt Mac, about his \"beautiful wife\" and \"wonderful step-children\" and advised Sgt Mac to settle down and get married too, even though he was only 21. He also offered him some recipes for cooking squirrel. But it was a conversation about flying that really struck Sgt Mac.\n\n\"Paul came up with a proposition,\" he explains. \"He said he wanted to get a private pilot's licence so he could fly home on leave\u2026 and he wanted to split the cost 50:50 with me\u2026 Looking back, I don't think he just got in that plane and took off. I think this was long-planned.\"\n\nSgt Mac took a liking to Meyer and made plans to meet him again in the pub. But a few days later, just before breakfast, he remembers hearing a loud roar and his barracks at RAF Lakenheath shaking. He didn't know it then but it was Meyer who'd taken off in the stolen Hercules, on his way home.\n\nIn his beautiful Cambridge garden, Vic Blickem shakes his head as he remembers that day. Back then Blickem worked for the USAF at Mildenhall in the casualty assistance office and it was his job to write to his superiors to tell them what had happened, so they could co-ordinate assistance to Meyer's family. He remembers struggling to fill in the paperwork.\n\n\"We were totally flummoxed - we didn't know if we should write Missing, Awol, Deserter, or what,\" he tells me. \"So we came up with some form of words or other to get by\u2026 We wrote messages, I guess, for a couple of days then we were told not to send any more, and not to ask for updates and we were just shut down. We were shut out. I asked my section commander if he thought Meyer was shot down and he said: 'Well, of course.'\"\n\nThe US Air Force still has a presence at RAF Mildenhall - it's now home to the 100th Refuelling Wing.\n\n\"See that older building there?\" asks Dr Robert Mackey, the USAF wing historian, as we wander around the huge base with its lawns shrivelled by the searing summer heat. \"That's where Meyer would have eaten his meals.\" We head towards the shade of a large tree, watching a Hercules thunder overhead. I ask Mackey how the USAF views the Meyer incident today.\n\n\"It was a series of bad decisions by people who should have known better,\" he says firmly. \"And now we have systems in place to stop this kind of thing from ever happening again.\" The facts that Meyer had just come back from Vietnam and was newly married were major stress factors. \"The Air Force may not have done what it needed to do to take care of a guy who was clearly in crisis.\"\n\nMackey can't pinpoint exactly the location of hard stand 21, from which Meyer taxied up the runway - the base has greatly changed over time and even the control tower is in its third reincarnation since 1969. A young bare-chested airman walks past us in shorts, eating ice cream.\n\n\"It was a different time,\" Mackey says. \"Put yourself in the position of those guys - it was 1969, not 1999 - it was the Cold War and you never knew what was going on. Was he stealing the plane? Deserting? Going to East Germany? No-one knew. The system reacted - albeit slower than it could have been. It was a sad incident that resulted in a guy getting killed at the end.\"\n\nSo did the system react by shooting him down?\n\n\"No!\" retorts Mackey. \"No. You've read the transcripts I've read and that is not what happened.\"\n\nBut the transcript of the Mildenhall control tower's conversations with the squadron leader, Col Kingery, various radar posts and the USAF's Central Security Control, don't quite tally with the sparse account in the official USAF official Accident Report (all obtained by Sgt Mac through a freedom of information request, along with the transcript of the conversation between Meyer and his wife).\n\nThe accident report claims that only two aircraft - a Hercules from RAF Mildenhall and an F-100 from RAF Lakenheath - were launched to try to find Meyer. Neither visual nor radio contact was established by either aircraft and they both simply returned to base. But the control tower transcript proves that a number of other aircraft took off to intercept Meyer's Hercules. At some point during the search, a British official is recorded telling Col Kingery: \"It looks like the French will be sending some fighters up now. This (position) will take him down into the French air which we couldn't really go down into.\"\n\nImage copyright National Archives\n\nAnd it wasn't just the French who scrambled fighters. In 1969, the east coast of England was peppered with Quick Reaction Alert (QRA) bases ready to respond to Russian threats.\n\nAt RAF Wattisham, Peter Nash was a senior aircraftsman with 29 Squadron and he distinctly remembers preparing three Lightning fighter aircraft to scramble.\n\n\"A klaxon went off, set off by the aircrew,\" he recalls. \"So we rushed out and got the aircraft ready, the pilots strapped in and quite soon Q1, the primary aircraft, was ordered to scramble. We knew something serious was going up.\"\n\nNash shows me photographs of the QRA hangar at Wattisham. He tells me that two of the three aircraft he helped prepare took off, loaded with missiles.\n\n\"It was later that morning we heard a USAF guy had stolen an aircraft from Mildenhall,\" he continues. \"And obviously it was our duty as the nearest QRA base to investigate unknown aircraft, so ours were sent to find him, shadow him and, if necessary, to shoot him down.\"\n\nThere is an account of that Wattisham operation in a 2011 book called The Lightning Boys. In it, former RAF pilot Rick Groombridge details how an American exchange pilot took over his aircraft at Wattisham to take part in the Meyer mission and was rumoured to have returned to base minus a missile. Groombridge declined to be interviewed but stands by his story. Nash, however, is adamant that both planes returned to base with all four missiles intact - he should know, he explains, as he was the chief armourer and was responsible for inspecting the weapons and removing the firing plugs.\n\nA few weeks after the incident, Nash was sent on a course where he met a fellow armourer from RAF Chivenor in Devon, who told him that at least one Hawker Hunter was scrambled from his base. Allegedly, the Hunter pilot had returned to Chivenor minus missiles and was met by the RAF police and taken away for a secret debrief along with his plane's camera gun. Nash says he keeps an open mind about the accuracy of the story but observes that Chivenor, being about 150 miles from where Meyer's Hercules went down in the Channel, was about 35 minutes flying time away for a Hunter.\n\n\"In other words,\" Nash says thoughtfully, \"it was well within capability.\"\n\nIn the Channel's busy shipping lanes, dive boat operator Grahame Knott continues to, as he puts it, \"mow the lawn\", searching for wreckage of Meyer's Hercules with Deeper Dorset, a team of divers. He's now scoured eight sq miles of seabed, examining targets with a side scanner and using remote cameras to pick up more detail on anything that looks particularly interesting. He's yet to spot anything, although there have been many false alarms. The next step will be to send down divers to look at specific targets. It's painstaking work - getting to this stage has taken 10 years of planning.\n\nImage copyright Deeper Dorset Image caption A wreck detected on the seabed by Grahame Knott\n\n\"Why do I do it?\" Knott wonders aloud. \"Honestly, I ask myself that all the time and I just keep coming back to the image of young Meyer up there in that plane, completely alone and I guess I'm just doing it for him. He was just a kid, you know?\" he says. \"Just a homesick kid.\"\n\nWhen I first interviewed Meyer's stepson, Henry Ayer, a few months back, he warned me, very gently, to be careful because this story would suck me in. He was just seven when \"Daddy Paul\" died and he's spent most of his adult life trying to get more information about what caused him to crash. Worn down by conspiracy theories, by conflicting accounts and hearsay, he now just wants to bring Daddy Paul's body home to Virginia.\n\nThe official line is that Meyer's body was never found. Yet eight weeks after Meyer's plane crashed into the Channel, two unidentified bodies washed up in Jersey. Detailed contemporary accounts from the Jersey Evening Post tell us that there was great excitement about a male corpse, thought to be aged around 25, found at La Saline Bay, St John's, by a rod fisherman. A subsequent inquest on the body concluded the young man had probably died from drowning. He was never identified although his teeth, which showed dental work of \"the British type\", were apparently not a match with Meyer's. He was buried in a pauper's grave on the island.\n\nBut the newspaper also carried reports about another unidentified body. On 17 July 1969, a launch, the Duchess of Normandy, was sailing back from Carteret in France with several dignitaries on board, when the skipper, Doug Park, spotted a badly decomposed, headless body floating in the water. He wanted to bring the body aboard but was asked not to because of the poor state the corpse was in.\n\nHis great friend, Ian Moignard, remembers Park's anger - and he also remembers Park describing the body.\n\n\"Doug Park told me it was in some sort of uniform\u2026 I think some kind of boiler suit. I do remember he said he'd written down some markings that were on the uniform - I presume he meant a service number on the lapel. But unfortunately the records at the harbour office have been destroyed or just can't be found.\"\n\nThe official USAF accident report tells us that Meyer had been dressed in plain clothes the previous evening at a house party - he'd borrowed a friend's trousers for the occasion - but just before he stole the plane, the report says, Meyer had changed into flight gear.\n\nPark told Moignard that he'd tied the uniformed body to a buoy and alerted the authorities. But by the time the authorities got there it had become detached and floated away.\n\nThe next day, the crew of a pleasure yacht, the Tien-Ho, also spotted the headless corpse but because there were very young children present, the skipper felt unable to haul it aboard. Those children, now long grown up, are currently searching for Tien-Ho's missing log book, in the hope their parents might have written down more details.\n\nSo the body floated free and Meyer's family was never told about the sighting.\n\nThe official telegram Meyer's widow Jane received from Washington, DC three weeks after Meyer disappeared is truly extraordinary.\n\n\"It is with deep regret,\" reads the document, \"that I learned of the death of your son.\" The word \"son\" has then been crossed out and the word \"husband\" penned above it. \"Overseas Commander has advised me,\" continues the telegram, \"that remains of your son have not been recovered.\"\n\nI show it to Vic Blickem as we sip coffee in his sunny garden.\n\nHe puts his head in his hands.\n\n\"That's just terrible, it's just terrible,\" he says. \"It's either so casual they don't care or so incompetent they are negligent. But how terrible for the family.\"\n\nHe laughs self-consciously.\n\n\"You know, we all hoped he'd make it,\" he says. \"We wanted him to make it, to get home and to live happily ever after - we even looked at maps to study islands south of England where we thought he might be able to land.\"\n\nSgt Paul Meyer's wife, Jane, hoped against hope for that fairy-tale ending too. The cockpit radio transcript tells us she had put the hot water on, all ready for him when he walked through the door. But the narrative didn't take the course she'd prayed for and it was the USAF chaplain who knocked on the door instead.\n\nOnce upon a time there was a young, troubled war veteran who just wanted to go home.

She had attended a baptism at her church and after stopping to get a takeaway, she drove back home.\n\n\"I drove into my garage and suddenly there was a man with his arm around my neck and a gun to my head,\" says Nancy. He demanded her handbag.\n\nNancy managed to wrestle herself away and turned to face her attacker, who was wearing a black baseball cap. Terrified, she accidentally handed him the bag of takeaway food.\n\n\"He demanded my purse a third time with expletives,\" says Nancy. \"I was close enough to him to shove my purse into his chest and when I did I cried out, 'Jesus save me!' and he immediately shot me in the head and I went down.\"\n\nNancy lay unconscious on the floor while her assailant ran off, taking the handbag but leaving her car, which he could easily have stolen. When she recovered consciousness, Nancy could barely breathe and was in excruciating pain.\n\nThe bullet had gone through her head and lodged in her right lung.\n\n\"When I came to I thought you're going to die, and then that's when God spoke to me and said, 'Get up.'

Nancy says her daughter described to her how he fell to the floor before he first saw her, such was his distress.\n\nYet as the police began to investigate, they found some shocking data on Frank's mobile phone, including photographs and text messages from another woman. Frank had been with her at the time of the attack, and not on a business trip.\n\nThe affair had been going on for three years.\n\nFind out more\n\nWhen Nancy was strong enough to leave intensive care she received a phone call from Frank via the hospital phone confessing to his adultery.\n\n\"I just completely began weeping,\" says Nancy. \"He actually was weeping so hard that I could barely even understand him talking, to tell me what had happened.\"\n\nFrank came to visit Nancy at the hospital several more times after that call, but there was more devastating news to come. While she was still recovering from surgery and undergoing further tests, the police told Nancy they had arrested a man in connection with the attack - John Franklin Howard, Nancy's husband, known to everyone as Frank.\n\nFor several years, Frank had been paying a gang of criminals to murder his wife.\n\n\"It was heartbreaking,\" says Nancy. \"I can remember even after an eye surgery just weeping and weeping and my mother had to come in and say, 'Stop, you can't cry like that, your eye has got to heal,' and, 'You can't be letting your head hang down like that.'\"\n\nThe criminals had been exploiting Frank, continually demanding more and more money. He was also spending hundreds of thousands of dollars on his girlfriend. So Frank had started to embezzle money from one of his wealthy clients - possibly more than $30m.\n\nNancy does not know why Frank wanted her killed. But she believes it's because he knew she would never agree to a divorce.\n\n\"I had made that vow to the Lord that I was not going to divorce him,\" says Nancy. \"So he began getting involved with [another woman], the next thing you know he's embezzling money because he's trying to show her that he's this rich man, and I think before long he was in over his head. He really had no option but to have me shot.\"\n\nAt Frank's trial, the jury took only two hours to find him guilty of attempted capital murder. He was sentenced to life in prison and will have to serve 30 years before he will be considered for parole. By then he will be about 85 years old.\n\nImage copyright Denton County Records Image caption Nancy would have been open to a reconciliation if Frank Howard had been acquitted\n\nIn fact Nancy did divorce her husband - before the trial - but if he had been acquitted she would have been willing to rebuild their relationship and remarry him, she says.\n\nSo the guilty verdict came as a \"kick in the stomach\".\n\n\"It's because I still loved him at the time, and you know I have to say I still love him, not in a romantic love, but in a love that he's the father of my children, and there's always going to be a love there,\" Nancy says.\n\nHer children were convinced their father had been wrongly convicted.\n\n\"He was continually telling them that he was innocent,\" says Nancy. \"That he had nothing to do with this, and he was a great husband and father until the time he wasn't. So I can totally understand why my children believe this.\"\n\nAfter the verdict she and her children left the courtroom separately. It was a month before they began to make contact again.\n\nDespite everything she has been through, Nancy has been able to forgive her husband - and even offered him forgiveness via her victim impact statement at the trial.\n\n\"I have forgiven him,\" says Nancy. \"The Bible says that if we don't forgive those who have harmed us then we are unable to be forgiven and I couldn't afford not to forgive him because I couldn't live with bitterness.\"\n\nNancy has not seen or heard from Frank since he went to prison. Although she has thought about visiting him, for now she is keeping her distance. But there is one question that preys on her mind, and that she would ask him if she could.\n\n\"What happened to the marriage?\" says Nancy. \"What in the world even caused him to want to go astray and find another woman? I know the shooting should be the most devastating part of it, but that has been the most devastating part.\"\n\nNancy's recovery has astonished doctors. She has had numerous operations to rebuild her face and eye socket and now has a prosthetic eye. She also has a full-time job working as a legal assistant in a law firm.\n\n\"I still have the bullet in my lung, but I had lost the use of my right arm and hand and I now am able to use it and I type,\" says Nancy.\n\nShe says she \"vigorously\" celebrates every birthday she has had since the shooting and still experiences joy singing in the church choir. Nearly six years after the horror of the attack on her doorstep, she is moving on.\n\n\"I'm able to be thankful once again for how God has saved my life and the healing that's happening in my children's lives, it's awesome,\" she says. \"I'm excruciatingly happy.\"\n\nListen to Nancy Shore speaking to Outlook on the BBC World Service\n\nNancy's story is told in the book, The Shooting of Nancy Howard: A Journey Back to Shore\n\nJoin the conversation - find us on Facebook, Instagram, YouTube and Twitter.", "authors": ["Lucy Wallis", "Bbc World Service"], "url": "http://www.bbc.com/news/stories-44521209"}, {"title": "US mum and daughter 'questioned over different surnames'", "text": "Image copyright Sylvia Acosta Image caption Dr Acosta was asked to prove her daughter was hers despite having her passport\n\nUS Customs and Border Protection has disputed a claim that one of its employees asked a woman to prove that she was the mother of her daughter.\n\nTexas mum Sylvia Acosta and her 15-year-old daughter, Sybonae Castillo, were both asked why they didn't share the same last name.\n\nDr Acosta says she was \"interrogated\" on Sunday at Dallas-Fort Worth airport.\n\nA CBP spokesperson said the video of the encounter \"does not support\" the claim.\n\n'One said I should consider changing my name'\n\nDr Acosta, who is chief executive of the Young Women's Christian Association, and her daughter had been on a tour of Europe when they arrived back to Texas on Sunday.\n\n\"There was a huge line of people,\" Dr Acosta said. \"We walked up to the customs officer.

And coach Nop was smiling for the first time, and almost speechless.\n\n\"I don\u2019t know what to say \u2013 I just want to see them, and hug them,\" he told me.\n\nI was then able to show him a note from Manchester United to the rescued boys. It was an invitation to visit Old Trafford next season, as most of the boys are passionate Man U fans. There was a little disbelief, and then elation, even from coach Nop, who admits he is a Liverpool fan who has failed to convert the rest of his team. \"Is this for real?\" they asked.\n\nGetting them to UK from this far-flung border town will be a challenge. Three of the boys and coach Ekapol, who was with them in the caves, are not recognised as full Thai citizens, a fairly common problem for communities along the Thai-Myanmar border. But they just made an almost miraculous escape from a cave.

They instruct the use of protective overalls, gloves and a respirator. I am wearing none of these.\n\nThere is also, I am informed, a risk of explosion. Not to mention the warning notices posted outside about venomous snakes and spiders.\n\nIn this room, at Europe\u2019s spaceport in Kourou, French Guiana, engineers mix together the ingredients for solid rocket fuel.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s exactly like baking a cake,\u201d says David Quancard, chief operating officer for ArianeGroup, a joint partner \u2013 along with Italian company Avio \u2013 in this European rocket fuel factory. \u201cIt starts as a liquid and then you cook it.\u201d\n\nYou might also like:\n\nUnlike your average cake, the mixing process is so hazardous that it takes place behind thick concrete walls in an isolated building surrounded by tropical jungle. Operations are controlled remotely from a blockhouse several hundred metres away, and the whole area is enclosed by security fences, barbed wire and watchtowers.\n\nSolid fuel rockets are typically used in missiles, such as the Trident ICBM or the French Exocet, and as boosters for larger launchers, like the ones strapped to the Space Shuttle.\n\nThe fuel manufactured here at the Kourou spaceport will power two different rockets: the boosters for the giant Ariane 5 launcher, designed for large spacecraft such as communications satellites and deep space science missions, and the first three stages of the 30m-high (100ft) Vega rocket \u2013 used to lift smaller payloads into low Earth orbit.\n\n\u201cSolid rocket boosters mean solid propellant \u2013 it looks a bit like rubber, solid but soft,\u201d says Quancard. \u201cYou have a huge cake of propellant that burns from the inner core to the outside to produce thrust.\"\n\nWith no internal valves, pipes or moving parts, the technology works on the same principle as a firework \u2013 you light it and it flies. Once it\u2019s lit, you can\u2019t stop it. That\u2019s one of the reasons the fuel needs to be manufactured here at the launch site. It is considered too dangerous to ship the solid rockets across the Atlantic from mainland Europe.\n\nIts multiple rotating blades swirl at between 500 and 1000 times a minute but never touching the sides to avoid the risk of a spark\n\nThe mixer used to combine the ingredients for the fuel is one of the largest in the world, and does indeed resemble the sort of machine you might find in an industrial bakery. Its multiple rotating blades \u2013 swirling at between 500 and 1,000 times a minute but never touching the sides to avoid the risk of a spark \u2013 mix together batches of 12 tonnes of propellant at a time.\n\nThe mixing bowls \u2013 known as pots \u2013 arrive at the facility already filled with an inert, viscous mixture of aluminium, iron oxide and binding chemicals. Then, with the pot heated to 75C (165F) and the blades rotating, ammonium perchlorate powder is dropped in from chutes above. A bit like the Colonel\u2019s herbs and spices, the exact mixture is a company secret.\n\nAfter mixing, the fuel is taken to another building to be cooked into the structure of the rocket. The casings for the Vega launcher are made in Italy and consist of lightweight hollow tubes of spun carbon fibre, lined with insulating material. These sections of rocket are lowered into casting pits and a mould resembling a long pole (known as a mandrel) is positioned in the centre.\n\nLike pouring a jelly, or the mixture for a cake, the pots of propellant are gradually emptied into the rocket casings and the whole pit heated to 50C (122F).\n\nMy mobile has been taken away from me \u2013 it\u2019s like the warnings about using phones on petrol station forecourts but with much more serious consequences\n\n\u201cAfter you cook it, it becomes solid,\u201d says Quancard. \u201cThen you remove the mandrel and you have the perfect internal shape.\u201d\n\nThe now-solid fuel is thoroughly tested for defects and stored for a month to stabilise the bonding between the fuel and the casing. With the addition of the ignition system and nozzle, the rocket is ready to go.\n\nAt this stage, it\u2019s considered safe. I hope so, because I find myself in a store room looking up at three giant fuelled rocket segments. My mobile has been taken away from me though \u2013 it\u2019s like the warnings about using phones on petrol station forecourts but with much more serious consequences.\n\nAriane 5 has been in service since 1996. With 98 launches and only two failures (none of them related to problems with solid rockets), it is considered one of the most reliable rockets in the world. Introduced in 2012, all 11 Vega launches have been successful. But both rockets are due an upgrade \u2013 both in performance and efficiency, to drive down costs and make them more competitive.\n\nThe first of a next generation carbon-fibre solid rockets is, right now, being prepared for testing at the spaceport. With 140 tonnes of propellant, it\u2019s the largest solid booster ever made in a single structure. Developed with funding from the European Space Agency (Esa), the P120C will be used for both the boosters on the new Ariane 6 and for the primary stage of an upgraded Vega C.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s exciting,\u201d says Quancard. \u201cFor the first time in history, we\u2019re using the same stage for two different launch vehicles.\u201d\n\nI say to my nephews that I prepare big fireworks \u2013 Marco Calcabrini\n\nIn a building known at Kourou as the BIP (B\u00e2timent d'Int\u00e9gration des Propulseurs), Quancard shows me a full-sized mock-up of the four-storey high P120C booster. It\u2019s used to test processes for moving the rockets around the spaceport and preparations for launch. Instead of rocket fuel, it\u2019s filled with an inert baked sugar mixture. Literally a giant cake.\n\n\u201cWe have the same viscosity as propellant,\u201d Quancard explains. \u201cIt\u2019s a way of testing in the safest way all the processes of manufacturing and assembly of this new engine.\u201d\n\nOnce built and tested, all solid rocket boosters eventually end up a few kilometres away on the launchpad. On the Vega pad, the engineer in charge, Marco Calcabrini, is busy preparing for his latest mission \u2013 launching Aeolus, an Esa satellite to measure global winds.\n\nWithin the launch gantry\u2019s 12-storey structure, Calcabrini\u2019s team will assemble the solid rocket sections of Vega before mounting the satellite above the liquid rocket at the top. This liquid final stage is used instead of a solid rocket because it enables flight controllers to place satellites in precise orbits.\n\nThree hours before launch, the whole gantry structure will be moved away on giant railway bogies, leaving the rocket on the pad exposed beneath \u2013 for obvious reasons \u2013 lightning conductors.\n\nI ask Calcabrini if it makes him nervous working so close to the solid rockets. \u201cI say to my nephews that I prepare big fireworks,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s never a standard job \u2013 we have risks every day and we have to manage them.\u201d\n\nOnce Calcabrini\u2019s Vega is ignited and launched, the rocket will carry on burning until it runs out of fuel\n\nCalcabrini has just 31 days between the first stage arriving at the pad and the rocket launching. Within that time, he has only eight days to fix the satellite in place and check everything\u2019s working.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s always pressure, but me and my colleagues love this job \u2013 we do it for the pressure, it helps us work better,\u201d he tells me. \u201cIt\u2019s a team. Everyone is committed to the launch campaign; we can\u2019t miss the launch time.\u201d\n\nSolid rockets are relatively simple, inexpensive and reliable. And, with its rocket fuel factory, Europe is a world leader in their development. But once Calcabrini\u2019s Vega is ignited and launched, the rocket will carry on burning until it runs out of fuel. Then, the remains of the precision carbon fibre body will fall into the ocean \u2013 too distorted to be reused. All being well, the wind monitoring satellite will reach orbit. But the rocket that got it there \u2013 with all the care and investment in manufacture, mixing and baking \u2013 will be gone forever.\n\n\u201cThis is the moment for which we work,\u201d says Calcabrini. \u201cThousands of people work on each mission for those [few] minutes of the launch \u2013 we work for that.\u201d\n\n--\n\nJoin 900,000+ Future fans by liking us on Facebook, or follow us on Twitter or Instagram.\n\nIf you liked this story, sign up for the weekly bbc.com features newsletter, called \u201cIf You Only Read 6 Things This Week\u201d.

Calculated judgements help us handle bank accounts, evaluate choices in the supermarket, make estimates and spot errors. We rely on our number sense when we decorate a room, bake a cake, go out for a meal or pop down to the shops. Each of these tasks requires numeracy: an ability to understand and work with numbers in everyday life.\n\nWhat happens when the majority of those people in reality aren\u2019t actually numerate enough to understand the interest rates on their student loans? Or whether that new sofa will fit through their living room doorway?\n\n\u201cWhat we all need in daily life is quite simple maths,\u201d says Mike Ellicock, chief executive of the charity National Numeracy. \u201cBut we also need a conceptual understanding applied to complex situations.\u201d In essence, this understanding applies to a broad range of mathematical information that may be intricate, abstract, or embedded in unfamiliar contexts.\n\nFor instance, you might need to calculate the true cost of buying versus hiring a car; whether to use award points or money to buy an airline ticket; or how to adjust a recipe to feed six people instead of four. Fractions, percentages, approximation, spatial understanding, rates of change, graphs and basic arithmetic are all part of number sense, but numeracy is not the same as classroom mathematics \u2013 nor is it some complex calculus. Rather, numeracy is how we interpret and apply our mathematical knowledge to the world around us.\n\nConsider managing your money. While technology certainly makes it easier to compare the costs of overdrafts, personal loans and mortgages, making estimates (and deciding whether an answer seems approximately right) is still very much a hands-on task.\n\nCompanies frequently assume a reasonable level of numerical understanding from their customers. But what happens when the majority of those people in reality aren\u2019t actually numerate enough to understand the interest rates on their student loans? Or whether that new sofa will fit through their living room doorway? Or how to quickly convert pounds to dollars when paying for something? Of course, these decisions are based on a number of factors, including human behaviour and value judgments, but mathematical literacy is the big one.\n\nPeople who are innumerate cannot calculate the value of a 25% off sale or split the bar tab with friends. They are unable to compare two retirement plans or choose between two mortgages or even two differently-sized cans of soda. They may confuse large or small orders of magnitude, fixate on certain risks, mistake correlation for causality or see meaningless patterns in random events. Innumeracy may even affect how you vote.\n\nAnd the problem seems to be getting worse. Roughly four in every five adults in the UK struggle with mathematical literacy. The mean numeracy proficiency scores of 16-65 year-olds in the US is significantly below average. (Worried about number crunching? Test your own numeracy with this adaptive diagnostic).\n\nSo, why should we care?\n\nWhile mathematical illiteracy makes life hard for individuals, its consequences are truly global: research suggests a correlation between poor numeracy skills and national unemployment, productivity, even physical health. For a post-Brexit Britain, a decline in numeracy could mean an economy that\u2019s less internationally competitive. But does it really matter if we cannot think quantitatively when we have phones and other devices that can do it for us?\n\nStuart Elliot, a visiting scholar at the National Academy of Sciences in the US works on comparing humans and computers in an effort to understand which skills might one day be overtaken by machine \u2013 and therefore become obsolete. \u201cI think we are close to the moment when machines will help not just with arithmetic calculations but with numerical reasoning,\u201d he says.\n\nIn the same way calculators replaced the need for long division by hand, computers might someday remove the need for qualitative reasoning.\n\nBut before we abandon maths to the sentient machines, let\u2019s consider the risks of doing that. The Internet of Things (a system of internet connected objects which can exchange information and data) is generating an ever-growing pool of our personal data: phones, fitness trackers, smart home devices, browsing history, travel cards and electronic medical records all spew out vast amounts of information about us \u2013 big data that can be collected and exploited.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cModels become hidden in the technology,\u201d warns Professor Celia Hoyles, Chair of Mathematics Education at University College London. \u201cThis can be very dangerous. We need to understand a computer\u2019s output is not magic: we have to question where the figures come from.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe population now falsely assumes you can calculate everything, because of technology,\u201d says Conrad Wolfram, Strategic director of Wolfram Europe. From exam results to fake-news, \u201cthings that have a number attached to them are sometimes used beyond their ability to judge.\u201d\n\nIt is also worth keeping in mind that good statistics are more than just guesses: they are based on clear and reasonable definitions, accurate measures and representative samples\n\nAnd in many ways, the ubiquity of statistics \u2013 often computer generated \u2013 underscores the importance of being fluent in numbers.\n\nDespite the processing power of digital systems, they are fallible. Even the most sophisticated can\u2019t yet compete with the human brain at higher levels. Although computers are good at quick calculations and identifying trends, humans excel at making judgements and spotting subtleties. A waiter at a restaurant might hand your table the wrong bill, for instance, and you\u2019d need mathematical literacy to double-check the correct balance.\n\n\u201cAs a human, you still have to set up a problem deliberately,\u201d says Wolfram. \u201cWhy are you doing this, and how might you have been fooled?\u201d Indeed, we will always need solid numeracy habits in order to make the most of the technology we use. Even the most sophisticated artificial intelligence machines are only as good as the data they are trained on, and human involvement, whether purposeful or accidental, can muddy that data.\n\nSo, what should we do? First, resist the urge to rely on phones and tablets. Instead, do basic calculations in your head or on paper. It takes a little effort and practice, but building good habits will help you spot errors and make more educated guesses where it really counts.\n\nSecond, pay attention to context. Asking the right questions can help you sort out the difference between real science and pseudoscience. It is also worth keeping in mind that good statistics are more than just guesses: they are based on clear and reasonable definitions, accurate measures and representative samples.\n\nThird, use computers wisely. They can save time and help you gain a conceptual understanding of more difficult quantitative tasks. They can also help double-check our procedures and enhance or accelerate our experience of problem-solving. Too often, we lack an intuitive feeling for very small or very big numbers like quantities or time spans; computers can help us understand the magnitude of a trillion-dollar budget, a one-hundred-thousand-word novel or a megaton of TNT in a country\u2019s nuclear stockpile.\n\nFinally, be sceptical. In order to use numbers and data, it\u2019s important to engage with the facts \u2013 sometimes, that means pitting quantitative analysis against what we\u2019re told is true. Without numeracy, we simply are not getting the full story.\n\n--\n\nTo comment on this story or anything else you have seen on BBC Capital, please head over to our Facebook page or message us on Twitter.\n\nIf you liked this story, sign up for the weekly bbc.com features newsletter called \"If You Only Read 6 Things This Week\".

Saman Gunan was returning from a mission to provide the group with air tanks when he ran out of oxygen.\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Rescue diver in Thai cave: \"I was very scared\"\n\nAged between about 11 and 17, the members of the Wild Boars football team had entered the Tham Luang cave system in the province of Chiang Rai during an excursion with their coach.\n\nConfirming the completion of the rescue operation, the Thai Navy Seals Facebook page announced: \"All 12 Wild Boars and coach have been extracted from the cave. All are safe.\"\n\nAnd at the house just below the mountains where the men who run the Wild Boars meet, there was laughter, shouts and cheers - and people shook hands in a very un-Thai way, says the BBC Jonathan Head.\n\n'Mission Accomplished'\n\nBy Nick Beake, at Chiang Rai hospital\n\nThis is the moment Mission Impossible became Mission Accomplished.\n\nFamilies in Chiang Rai gathered at the hospital to watch the final ambulances bring in their precious cargo. Some said they couldn't believe it, others said they had never lost hope. All wore the brightest of smiles.\n\nUp on the eighth floor, doctors - who declared this morning that the first eight boys to be rescued are doing well - will now be examining their remaining team mates and their coach. Psychologists will be assessing the impact a fortnight trapped underground has had.\n\nThe Wild Boars footballers went into the Tham Luang cave as a team. They survived as a team. And tonight, at the end of a remarkable 72-hour rescue, they are together as a team once again.\n\nHow were they rescued?\n\nA team of 90 expert divers - 40 from Thailand and 50 from overseas - worked in the Tham Luang caves.\n\nThey guided the boys and their coach through darkness and submerged passageways towards the mouth of the cave system.\n\nGetting to and from the trapped group was an exhausting round trip, even for experienced divers.\n\nThe process included a mixture of walking, wading, climbing and diving along guide ropes.\n\nWearing full-face masks, which are easier for novice divers than traditional respirators, each boy was accompanied by two divers, who also carried his air supply.\n\nThe toughest part was about halfway out at a section named \"T-Junction\", which was so tight that the divers had to take off their air tanks to get through.\n\nBeyond that a cavern - called Chamber 3 - was turned into a forward base for the divers.\n\nThere the boys could rest before making the last, easier walk out to the entrance. They were then taken to hospital in Chiang Rai.\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Wife and father remember 'hero' Thai diver: \"He loved helping others\"\n\nThe last of the rescue team - three Thai Navy Seals and a doctor - emerged from the cave complex some hours after the last member of the trapped group was released.\n\nWho are the boys and their coach?\n\nDetails have emerged of members of the team and their coach.\n\nCaptain Duganpet Promtep, 13, is described as a motivator and highly respected by his teammates. He had apparently been scouted by several Thai professional clubs.\n\nMyanmar-born Adul Sam-on, 14, speaks several languages, and was the only team member to be able to communicate with British divers when they were first discovered.\n\nIt was 17-year-old Peerapat Sompiangjai's birthday when the group became trapped in the cave. The snacks the boys brought with them to celebrate are likely to have helped them survive their ordeal.\n\nAssistant coach Ekapol Chantawong, 25, was said to be the weakest of the group when they were found, as he had reportedly refused to eat any of the food and gave it instead to the boys.\n\nWhat next for the boys?\n\nThe first eight boys to be rescued - on Sunday and Monday - are still in hospital but said to be in good mental and physical health.\n\nThey have undergone X-rays and blood tests, and will remain under observation in hospital for at least seven days.\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Child psychiatrist: \"It will be a challenge for these children to go back to normal life\"\n\nTheir parents have been allowed to see them through a glass window at the hospital, but they are being quarantined.\n\nDrinking contaminated water in the cave or being exposed to bird or bat droppings in the cave could lead to dangerous infections, experts say.\n\nThe boys lost weight during their time in the caves and are keen to eat.

That was really hard.\n\nLife is never the same again.\n\nIn this photograph, I am a daughter and a sister - and I'm no longer those things.\n\nImage copyright Simon Bray\n\nFriends have said to me: \"Oh but you are. You're still your mum's daughter. You're still Geoff's sister\" But actually I'm not really. I am my dad and my mum's daughter. But no-one thinks of me as a daughter. No-one calls me their sister.\n\nSo, your identity changes for ever and I can say I had a brother and I know what it feels like to be a little sister and I know what it feels like to have a father and to be a father's daughter - but I am no longer those things and that is really hard.\n\nWhen someone dies, it can be so shocking and you feel like it ought to be very very noisy, like people banging drums and playing trombones and shouting, and actually it's very quiet because that person's gone so you don't hear their voice anymore.\n\nImage copyright Simon Bray\n\nAfter the funeral, you are left in a very quiet place - sometimes that can feel wrong because the feelings aren't very quiet.\n\nI do think that having experienced such pain and loss has helped me to have a much deeper appreciation of beauty.\n\nIt feels like once you've been to a place of such pain, you have a deeper understanding of the world around you - and I just, well, I look on life differently.\n\nJames\n\nImage copyright Simon Bray\n\nThe original photo (left) was taken at Hillsborough, home ground of Sheffield Wednesday Football Club. It was at a Bristol Rovers game in League One, the season that we beat Sheffield United to promotion to the Championship.\n\nFrom the age of 12, Hillsborough was the thing I did with my dad. For the next 20 odd years, come what may, most Saturdays, I would go back and me and Dad would go to the match together and sit in the same seats, with our season tickets. Those two seats, 97 and 98, Row R, South Stand, they're our seats.\n\nHillsborough is one of these old grounds in amongst the terraced houses. So, you'd just find a parking space wherever you can and walk down the hill, over the bridge and into our seats.\n\nImage copyright Simon Bray\n\nThen, we'd chat to the people we'd sat around for the past 15 years or so. Dad had all sorts of routines - he wouldn't have a shower on match day, he always wore his Sheffield Wednesday boxer shorts, he'd always have his hat in his bag so if we weren't doing well it was: \"Right, it's time for the hat,\" so he'd put his hat on.\n\nHe'd been diagnosed at the end of October and he'd deteriorated that season - but he was there on the last game.\n\nHe was very ill though. Sheffield Wednesday had stayed up and he just kind of sat down. He kind of had a little look around and just began to cry and I think he thought at that point that could well be his last game.\n\nImage copyright Simon Bray\n\nI don't think the weight of the situation had escaped anybody. He was really upset - and as our friends saw that, they all started crying and then it was just a bit of a car crash from then on. It was just a very poignant moment.\n\nOn returning to the ground for the photograph, we were playing Charlton. We scored first and that was the moment that, for the past 20 odd years, we'd jump up and hug and just go crazy and shout and just be a bit ridiculous quite honestly.\n\nBut as I jumped up that day, it was great to see the football and stuff, but it was a bit flat. Although, it was nice to think: \"Yeah, we've scored. Go on, Dad. There you go.\"\n\nIt was a good intentional way of reflecting, which is really healthy.

Having met online and communicated for around six months I moved from my home in Germany.\n\nImage copyright Simon Bray\n\nIt was just a normal evening. He had been at work and I wasn't working at the time so I was always hanging around for 17:00, waiting for him to get home.\n\nIt was still really exciting to know that we were together and just that I had moved over here. We just went for a walk like we did most evenings.\n\nHe was very funny and I think it was the sense of humour that brought us very close quite quickly because that really connects you I think.\n\nAfter Paul passed away, I returned to Penzance to restage the photograph in the same location and to talk about Paul and the time that we had together.\n\nImage copyright Simon Bray\n\nWhen you [the photographer] asked me about taking that picture with my eyes closed, it was as if the inside of my eyelids was a film, there were all these images - Penzance together with Paul, spending Mazey Day together, walking along Sennen beach, taking a trip to Falmouth together - Cornwall is just so connected to the relationship.\n\nI just wonder what's it like for other people as you're going through the process of processing it all?\n\nThere's a distinct before and after. There's this cut-off point and you think: \"Is this where the world should stop?\" But it doesn't.\n\nThis is where everything changed in your world - but the world just keeps on spinning and spinning.

Cast your eye over them - how are they doing? Parched? Over-watered? Or surviving?\n\nFor people living in a rented house or a flat with a cupboard-sized balcony, buying a few houseplants has become an increasingly popular way to make home feel more personal.\n\nPinterest and Instagram accounts such as Urban Jungle Blog are full of pictures of beautifully curated plant-filled rooms.\n\nAnd earlier this year, a national survey in the US indicated gardening by people aged under-35 had reached an all-time high.\n\nYes, for some people, plants are basically their babies.\n\nBut with this summer bringing unfamiliar weather territory to the UK, some plant parents are a bit panicked.\n\nWith increased temperatures indoors as well as out, what can you do to keep your beloved greenery alive until the rainy British summer we know and love returns?\n\nWe asked Abby Jamet, who works for a London garden design company, for her top tips.\n\n\"Summer is when plants are trying to grow and blossom flowers - but this year, the extreme weather is challenging them, forcing them to divert their energy to cope,\" she said.\n\n\"Houseplants are very receptive to light and moisture levels, so increased and prolonged exposure to sunlight now threatens them, as well as things like air-conditioning or homes that are hotter than usual.\"\n\nFive ways to care for your plants in hot weather:\n\nGet to know your plants. Find out their names and start googling. Do they like direct sunlight or prefer shade? Do they like humid or dry conditions? Even if you water it perfectly, if your plant is living in the wrong conditions, it won't thrive. For example, tropical plants, such as rubber plants, kentia, ficus and some ferns, prefer humidity - but Mediterranean plants, such as thyme and lavender, prefer dry air\n\nCheck their location in your house - if they are spending hours in direct sunlight, think about whether this is their ideal spot\n\nIn hotter weather, most plants will need more water and probably twice a day. Don't waste water by watering them inefficiently or incorrectly. Aim the nozzle of your watering can at the soil, not the leaves. Use room-temperature water - cold or hot water will shock them. Do it in morning or evening, but not in the middle of the day when the water will evaporate quickly. Roots should grow down, not up - but if watered in sunlight, the roots will travel upwards in search of the evaporating water. Soak the soil and leave it for 10-15 minutes. If the water is absorbed, water it again\n\nImage copyright Abby Jamet Image caption Abby Jamet, who works at a garden design company, says the heatwave is challenging many plants in the UK\n\nIf your plant looks a bit sad, try feeding it with some leftover tea leaves, which are rich in nitrogen, inside your watering can\n\nIf you have small garden shrubs or large potted plants on a balcony, water them thoroughly a few times a week, rather than a little every day. For thirsty outdoor plants, adding a few dead leaves on the topsoil will create an insulating layer so that moisture doesn't evaporate. If they are south-facing, water morning and evening to keep them moist\n\nWhat if they're already parched?\n\nYou need to soak the plant to rehydrate it. The soil will probably repel water at first, so add some water, allowing the roots to absorb it, wait, then add more. Eventually, the water will sink in\n\nOr you could sit the plant in a bowl of water for 15 minutes\n\nWhat to avoid doing:\n\nDon't sprinkle them for minutes on end. Instead, soak the soil then leave it\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption That's more like it - happy house plants\n\nDon't let plants sit in water - the roots will rot and flies could lay their eggs there. If you need more drainage, you can put pebbles at the bottom of the pot\n\nDon't panic about succulents or cacti - they love hot, dry weather. Check they're not parched - but don't fall into the trap of overwatering them\n\nWhat if I'm going away for the weekend or on holiday?\n\nA drip feeder made from a plastic bottle should keep them going.\n\nCut a small hole in a plastic bottle, fill the bottle with water, and then push it into the soil. The liquid will drip through and feed them.\n\nWarning signs:\n\nIf leaves are wilting, drooping, or changing colour, it's a sign that the plant needs more attention\n\nMost plants die from too much love - don't drown them in water, or let them sit in water. Some leaves develop orange spots, or rust, if they are being overwatered\n\nBut above all, Abby says: \"Don't panic. The heatwave probably won't kill them. If you water them often and thoroughly, pay attention to them, and love them, they'll be fine.\"\n\nBy Georgina Rannard, UGC and social news", "authors": [], "url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-44767498"}, {"title": "San Francisco: Where a six-figure salary is 'low income'", "text": "Image copyright Getty Images\n\nA family getting by on $117,400 (\u00a387,970) in one US city can now be considered 'low income', according to government figures. How can that be the case?\n\nThat workers with six-figure salaries could be considered \"poor\" is something that might surprise many people.\n\nBut taking into account income and housing costs that is the reality for some families - who may be eligible for housing assistance - according to a recent report from the US Department of Housing and Urban Development.\n\nIn San Francisco and nearby San Mateo and Marin Counties it said $117,400 for a family of four was \"low income\", while $73,300 (\u00a354,900) was \"very low income\" - the highest figures anywhere in the country.\n\nA look at how earnings vary across the US and between jobs illustrates what is going in the city and the country as a whole - factors explored by a new study and interactive website by The Hamilton Project at the Brookings Institution.\n\nBelow the poverty line\n\nImage copyright Getty Images\n\nNearly two thirds of American families of four live on less than San Francisco's \"low-income\" threshold of $117,400.\n\nAcross the US, the median (middle) household income for a family of four is $91,000 (\u00a368,170). For a family of any size, the figure is $59,000 (\u00a344,180). (Median incomes are used throughout this piece).\n\nAnd, in a country of 326m, more than 40m people in families of all sizes live below the poverty line, which is $25,100 (\u00a318,800) for a family of four.\n\nLooking at all jobs, earnings are much higher in some large cities than they are in the rest of the country.\n\nSan Francisco in particular stands out.\n\nThe city has become a hub for IT and other high-tech industry - leading to an economic boom which has seen it become home to many of the country's highest-paid workers.\n\nBetween 2008 and 2016, individual earnings for full-time workers aged 25 to 64 in the San Francisco metro area, which also includes Alameda and Contra Costa counties, grew by 26% - far faster than in many other large metro areas. By 2016, earnings had risen to $63,000 (\u00a347,200)\n\nOf course, there are other areas of the US with high wages.\n\nAmong 25 to 64-year-olds, typical earnings for full-time workers in recent years were $65,000 (\u00a348,670) in San Jose, $60,600 (\u00a345,400) in Washington DC and $55,700 (\u00a341,700) in Boston.\n\nIn high-earning places like these there are many jobs that pay well.\n\nIn San Francisco, doctors - the highest-paid occupation - can expect to earn $193,400 (\u00a3144,800). The typical chief executive or public administrator is paid $167,300 (\u00a3125,260), while software developers can expect $117,100 (\u00a387,670).\n\nBut there are plenty of people earning much less.\n\nThe lowest-paid people in San Francisco are farm workers, who typically earn $18,500 (\u00a313,850), while childcare workers earn $22,300 (\u00a316,700).\n\nWages in other big US cities are noticeably lower.\n\nIn Detroit, for example, a doctor typically earns $144,300 (\u00a3108,000), while childcare workers receive only $15,000 (\u00a311,230).\n\nHowever, the wide variation in earnings is only part of the equation.\n\nLiving costs, particularly for housing, play a significant role in determining how far workers can stretch their earnings.\n\nIn fact, living costs in general for the San Francisco area are 25% higher than the national average.\n\nHowever, as earnings are 45% higher than for the nation as a whole, many people in San Francisco are still coming out ahead.\n\nMore like this\n\nIt is when we look at housing costs specifically that the comparison is less favourable.\n\nIn many large cities, the problems of high rents and home prices have been exacerbated by strict building rules and growing income inequality.\n\nIt is high rents in San Francisco that are behind the decision to label some six-figure earning families as \"low income\".\n\nFor example, a fair market rent for a two-bedroom apartment in the San Francisco area is considered to be $3,121 (\u00a32,340) per month - nearly twice the 2008 figure of $1,592 (\u00a31,190). In Cincinnati, Ohio, the figure is $845 (\u00a3632). This difference (270%) is much larger than the difference in median family incomes (50%).\n\nImage copyright Getty Images\n\nAs such, affordability is a significant challenge for many people in San Francisco.\n\nAcross the US, the government typically defines a low-income family as one that earns less than 80% of the median income for families of the same size, in the same area.\n\nBut in places with unusually high housing costs the threshold can be higher.\n\nIn San Francisco, high rents have driven the government's \"low income\" threshold of $117,400 (\u00a387,970) almost as high as the median income for a family of four in the area - $118,400 (\u00a388,630).\n\nWhile falling below this mark does not automatically entitle families to government housing assistance such as subsidies and public housing, it is a factor that is considered.\n\nMore important than money\n\nBut it is of course worth considering that, for many people, high prices are something that they are willing to put up with for a good quality of life.\n\nSan Francisco is certainly an expensive place to live, but good weather and a rich cultural life attract many residents.\n\nAcross the US, it is often the case that the places rated most highly for quality of life - like San Francisco and Santa Barbara in California and Honolulu in Hawaii - tend to have a high cost of living.\n\nWhile families with six-figure earnings may not be \"low-income\" in the broadest sense, the challenge remains for expensive cities across the US to find ways to offer a good quality of life to all of their residents.\n\nA critical look at how to make more affordable housing available might be an obvious place to start.\n\nAbout this piece\n\nThis analysis piece was commissioned by the BBC from experts working for an outside organisation.\n\nProf Jay Shambaugh is the director of The Hamilton Project and a senior fellow in Economic Studies at the Brookings Institution.\n\nRyan Nunn is the policy director of The Hamilton Project and a fellow in Economic Studies at the Brookings Institution.\n\nThe Brookings Institution is a not-for-profit public policy organisation, conducting research that leads to new ideas for solving problems facing society.", "authors": ["Ryan Nunn", "Jay Shambaugh", "The Hamilton Project", "Brookings Institution"], "url": "http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-44725026"}, {"title": "A mother's place 'is in the home'", "text": "Image copyright Getty Images\n\nA woman's place may no longer be in the home - but if she has pre-school children, it should be, according to an annual survey of social attitudes.\n\nOnly 7% of British Social Attitudes survey interviewees felt mothers of under-5s should have full-time jobs.\n\nPart-time work was judged acceptable by 38% - but one in three felt those with under-5s should be stay-at-home mums.\n\nMeanwhile, 72% disagreed that \"a man's job is to earn money - a woman's job is to look after home and family\".\n\nOlder people, unqualified people and those on lower incomes were more likely to support a traditional view of women as homemakers and men as breadwinners.\n\nA representative random sample of 3,988 adults were interviewed between July and October 2017.\n\nParental leave\n\nLead author, Eleanor Attar Taylor, from the National Centre for Social Research, said: \"Attitudes towards gender issues depend on the topic under question.\n\n\"Looking at issues around roles in the home and labour market, we find that there is a marked reduction of support for traditional gender roles of the man working and the woman looking after the home, mirrored by increasing agreement that both men and women should contribute to household income.\n\n\"However, when it comes to maternal employment, the majority of people still think either mothers should stay at home or work part-time, particularly when there is a child under school age.\n\n\"In addition, regarding parental leave, there is little difference between the sexes, with a majority feeling the mother should take all or most of the leave.\"\n\nMotherhood v career\n\nCarolyn in Berkshire is a working mother of a two-year-old.

Why did his mother and grandmother, who have been convicted of his manslaughter, fail to call for help until it was too late?\n\nJordan Burling weighed under six stone (37kg) when he died, having wasted away due to extreme malnutrition.\n\nHis life ended on a makeshift bed in the lounge of the family home, where he had been confined for some months.\n\nIt wasn't the first tragedy at the house in Butterbowl Garth in Farnley, Leeds.\n\nJordan's grandfather, Herbert Cranston, took his own life in a bedroom in 2006.

On his walls were posters of Top Gear's The Stig, characters from the Final Fantasy computer game franchise and Chelsea footballers.\n\nOne of his biggest obsessions was WWE wrestling, and he, Dawn and Abigail stayed up most of the night watching live events beamed from the United States.\n\nHe was described by his family as \"independent\" and \"stubborn\" and had seen himself as the \"man of the house\" when he turned 18 on 4 July 2015.\n\nImage caption Denise Cranston, 70, Abigail Burling, 25, and Dawn Cranston, 45 all had a part to play\n\nBut two months later Jordan was seen \"looking pale\" and covered with a bed sheet on a chair in the lounge by a council housing department employee.\n\nIt was at this point Steven made regular contact with Dawn via text, urging her to take their son to see a doctor.\n\nPoundland colleagues said Dawn claimed she had taken him to the doctors and they \"couldn't work out what was wrong\" - but in reality he hadn't seen a GP for six years.\n\nHis mother told the court he wouldn't have seen a doctor even if one had been called due to an incident when he been turned away for arriving late for an appointment.\n\nIn her defence, Denise said she feared her grandson would lash out if she called a medic.\n\nShe told police, \"he was an adult, it was his choice\".\n\nImage copyright BBC Worldwide/Taylor Herring PR Image caption Jordan was an avid gamer and collected DVDs, with posters on his bedroom wall including Top Gear's The Stig and characters from the Final Fantasy computer game series\n\nDuty of care was a key argument in the trial, with the defence saying 18 was a \"magic number\" - the point at which someone can refuse medical treatment.\n\nThe prosecution argued \"age did not come into it\" and Denise and Dawn retained a duty of care due to Jordan's worsening condition and vulnerability.\n\nIn the final months of his life, they cleaned him in the lounge and treated his worsening bedsores by washing them with salt water and covering them with sanitary pads.\n\nDawn agreed it was like caring for a baby again and changed his adult nappy twice a day.\n\nShe slept downstairs on the sofa beside Jordan, who lay on a mattress on top of an inflatable bed.\n\nHis mother denied there were fewer and fewer nutrients entering his body at this point, but Jordan's weight was dropping alarmingly.\n\nMeals were eaten in front of the TV on his lap, although his mother said she couldn't be sure how much he had eaten as there was a bin at the foot of the sofa.\n\nDawn eventually called 999 on 30 June when Jordan's breathing became shallow. He died in the room he had become confined to.\n\nA dietician said Jordan's body mass index (BMI) was the lowest she had ever recorded.\n\nImage caption Child protection expert Dr Bernard Gallagher said the family clearly slipped through the net in terms of agency support\n\nDr Van Velsen said Dawn's depersonalisation disorder might have caused her to fail to \"manage a situation in a way that was healthy\".\n\nIt could explain the ways she handled both the birth of her baby and Jordan's death, which was recorded as acute bronchopneumonia, resulting from his malnutrition, immobility and infected bed sores.\n\nThe situation could have been exacerbated by the lack of agency support - something child protection expert, Dr Bernard Gallagher, said should have been \"more long-term and more for forceful\".\n\nBut prosecutor Nicholas Lumley told the trial: \"There was no other reason for his dying, no natural or other illness, apart from the conditions created for him by the accused.\n\n\"Jordan's neglect and maltreatment went on and on and on.\"", "authors": ["Tom Airey", "Bbc News"], "url": "http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-leeds-44643037"}, {"title": "Why was Elon Musk at the Thai cave rescue?", "text": "Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Elon Musk has tweeted that he visited the Thai rescue operation but did not share images of himself at the site\n\nTech entrepreneur Elon Musk's attempt to help the Thai cave rescue mission has attracted both praise and criticism.\n\nThe SpaceX and Tesla chief posted on social media that he had visited the operation's command centre, where he said he had left a mini-submarine that had been designed to carry a trapped football team to safety.\n\nThe head of the rescue mission thanked Mr Musk for his offer.\n\nBut he said the sub could not be used.\n\n\"The equipment they brought to help us is not practical with our mission,\" Narongsak Osotthanakorn explained.\n\n\"Even though their equipment is technologically sophisticated, it doesn't fit with our mission to go in the cave.\"\n\nThai Navy Seals subsequently announced that all 12 boys and their coach had been brought out safely.\n\nMr Musk has since tweeted an email from Richard Stanton - one of two British caving experts called in to front the rescue - which had urged the business leader to build the capsule as quickly as possible.\n\nMr Musk first suggested he could help save the trapped children and their football coach on 4 July, in response to a Twitter user's suggestion that he might be able to assist the effort at the Tham Luang caves in Chiang Rai.\n\nTwo days later Mr Musk confirmed he was sending engineers from SpaceX and his Boring Company - which specialises in drilling - to Thailand.\n\nHe followed with several posts speculating about possible technical solutions to the problem.

including to Neville Chamberlain - which are much sought after by collectors.\n\nImage caption Winston Churchill was a prolific signer of his work\n\nOne presentation copy to pass through Mr Harrington's shop was a Frankenstein signed by Mary Shelley to Lord Byron, who was famously part of the party where she first created the story.\n\nIt sold for more than \u00a3300,000.\n\nSimilarly, a copy of Tale of Two Cities signed by Charles Dickens to George Eliot went for \u00a3200,000.\n\nBut there is a higher grade even than that: the \"unicorn\", as Mr Harrington puts it.\n\nThat is the book signed to the person to whom it is also dedicated.\n\nErnest Hemingway's For Whom the Bell Tolls provides a good idea of the difference in prices.\n\nA simple signed copy would cost about \u00a37,000, inscribed \u00a310,000 and a presentation copy up to \u00a325,000.\n\nBut a copy signed to Martha Gellhorn, to whom the book is dedicated, would sell for \u00a3200,000.\n\nA short history of signed books\n\nImage copyright Hulton Archive/Getty Images Image caption There are no known signed copies of Jane Austen\n\nSigned books are a relatively recent phenomenon.\n\nIt was not until the end of the 18th Century that authors started to sign their work, but even then inscriptions were more commonly written by secretaries rather than writers themselves.\n\nFor example, there are no signed copies of Jane Austen's books but there are 13 presentation copies of Emma, which are highly cherished (while a first edition of Pride and Prejudice can be bought for about \u00a365,000).\n\nImage copyright Hulton Archive/Getty Images Image caption Charles Dickens was one of the first authors to go on national book tours\n\nBy the middle of the 19th Century, signing became a common occurrence.\n\nCharles Dickens, a \"superstar even in his day\", was a big proponent of signed books, Mr Harrington says.\n\n\"He would tour the country reading his works and signing copies for people.\n\n\"He was undoubtedly one of the first to do book tours.\"\n\nIt has to be the right book though.\n\nTake HG Wells, for example.\n\nA signed copy of War of the Worlds could fetch between \u00a325,000 and \u00a330,000.\n\nBut a signed copy of one of his lesser-known books \"I would not give you \u00a3200 for\", Mr Harrington says.\n\n\"It has to be the book they are best known and loved for.\"\n\nImage copyright Hulton Archive/Getty Images Image caption Mary Shelley devised the idea for Frankenstein in a story-telling competition at a party with friends including her husband Percy Shelley and Lord Byron\n\nThe quality of the book also matters. \"You want to find the book in the same condition as when it was born\", adds Mr Harrington.\n\nAnd being a first edition helps.\n\nThe set of Harry Potters being auctioned by Vectis in Thornaby comprises seven signed deluxe editions.\n\nThey belong to Ged Quinn, an electrician from Farnborough who bought them 10 years ago as an investment.\n\n\"I got one from somewhere and then, as any collector knows, I wanted to get the complete set,\" he says.\n\n\"I bought them to sell...

Soon after war broke out and he ended up moving schools five times, mostly without his parents. He explains how he managed to break into the world of fashion photography, attending every notable show over the past 60 years.\n\nI was only four years old when I left Newcastle with my parents.\n\nBut many others were doing the same; we were as a tribe and Geordies were all around me throughout my childhood even though much of it was spent in Essex.\n\nWe moved south and Newcastle came with us.\n\nImage copyright Catwalking Image caption Yves Saint Laurent with Catherine Deneuve in Paris in 1994. \"The paparazzi scramble was already thick when I reached them backstage after the show,\" says Moore. \"Suddenly a security guard minding the diamond jewellery on a table in front frantically swiped the surface clean with one arm and, in a synchronised motion, I jumped into the space created\"\n\nIt was soon after we arrived in the South to set up a new home that war broke out and the child evacuation policies meant that my schooling was a horrible mess.\n\nI was moved five times in as many years, each to a different house and school and most of the time without my parents.\n\nWork was easy to come by and my father arranged my first job. He was a great believer in joining a strong union and jobs in printing were coveted and well paid.\n\nI don't remember but he must have been disappointed that the place he sent me to at G & Watson, although a printing company, was in fact inside their photography department.\n\nImage copyright Catwalking Image caption French designer Jacques Esterel's first ambition was to be an entertainer, and this love crept into his presentations. \"It is the first time I saw an elevated catwalk,\" remembers Moore, \"more like theatre than fashion show\". This photo was taken by Moore in 1967 in Paris\n\nI left with a strong technical grounding and I was recommended to Vogue Studio as an assistant a couple of years later.\n\nTheir studio in Shaftesbury Avenue in the centre of London did, of course, change everything for me.\n\nAs a working-class lad I found the place, people and attitudes at Vogue in the 1950s completely different to anything I had experienced up until then; it was a bit of a culture shock actually.\n\nBut given my turbulent childhood I suppose I had learnt by then to take change in my stride a bit more than some would have.\n\nI worked for many photographers during that time, but of course some stand out now because they became famous, like Cecil Beaton and Henry Clarke.\n\nImage copyright Catwalking Image caption \"Before Kate, Linda and Naomi there was Iman, Jerry and Marie. Each decade has its standout models; these days it's the Hadid sisters, Gigi and Bella\"\n\nThere too, I became aware of style for the first time. Before Vogue Studios, people, in my eyes, were wearing clothes.\n\nBut I eventually realised that the same clothes on different people were not necessarily the same; a person's style is an individual thing.\n\nI travelled to Paris for the haute couture for the first time in 1967. By this time I had set up my own business and some of my fashion clients were newspapers and magazines interested in covering the new seasons there twice a year.\n\nThe scene was really small compared to now and press members were treated with suspicion.\n\nImage copyright Catwalking Image caption Supermodels including Naomi Campbell and Linda Evangelista modelling Fendi in 1992 in Milan\n\nWe were not allowed in to photograph the presentation to clientele and even journalists would be thrown out if caught sketching the designs, so paranoid were the couture houses of being plagiarised.\n\nInstead a few ensembles were selected to be photographed either in the salon later or in the street outside the events.\n\nIt was later in the 1970s when the ready-to-wear brands made a push to attract buyers through organised trade weeks that the catwalk circuits were born.\n\nI have been covering them continuously ever since.\n\nThe term \"catwalk photographer\" was coined much later, around the same time as another catchy phrase \"the supermodel\"; some time in the early 1990s.\n\nIt looks glamorous from the outside looking in, but in reality it is a tough business with high levels of stress and physical hardships.\n\nThose of us that have endured after many years are few and there is a strong camaraderie, especially among the photographers.\n\nOf course with every positive there is a negative and that I suppose is the downside in the divided life I have lived - time on the road is time away from home.\n\nImage copyright Catwalking Image caption Moore describes Alexander McQueen as one of the \"showmen of the catwalk\". This design is from Autumn/Winter 2010\n\nMy favourites have always naturally been from designers who cared that their presentations would be very visual, knowing that the show had to photograph well to reach the wider audience later in the news media.\n\nShowmen of the catwalk, like Thierry Mugler, Issey Miyake, Jean Paul Gaultier, Vivienne Westwood and Rei Kawakubo, then more recently Miuccia Prada, Hussein Chalayan and of course John Galliano and Alexander McQueen.\n\nI have often enjoyed just as much witnessing the circus around the events and the extraordinary people in the shadows.\n\nWhether backstage or in the front row, I loved following the style antics of Italian Vogue editor Anna Piaggi and style icon Issy Blow who on some days would have changed two or three times a day.\n\nImage copyright Catwalking Image caption Moore enjoyed following the \"style antics\" of fashion followers such as Anna Piaggi, who wrote for Italian Vogue\n\nIt is also true that to some extent you can predict the fashion trends from what the front row is wearing or from how they are reacting to the shows, especially the expression on the face of Suzy Menkes who I worked with for 25 very special years at the International Herald Tribune.\n\nThen there is also US Vogue editor Andre Leon-Talley who, because of his tall stature and conscious style, would catch a lot of attention as he walked into a room with the all-powerful Anna Wintour.\n\nYou might also like:\n\nI suppose it always has made good sense to watch the watchers.\n\nI have seen people with money flounder with so much choice that they do not know what they should wear, and those with so much less create an individual style just by ripping off a collar or painting an old pair of shoes.\n\nImage copyright Catwalking Image caption Moore says fashion is for anyone who wants to be stylish\n\nFashion is at its worst when it dictates to the many and at its best when it offers a backdrop or mood to encourage more individual expressions of style.\n\nI have learned that fashion is for anyone who cares to be stylish, and that it has nothing to do with age, class or gender.\n\nCatwalking: Fashion through the Lens of Chris Moore opened at the Bowes Museum, Barnard Castle, County Durham, on Saturday and runs until 6 January 2019.\n\nAs told to Sian Davies.", "authors": [], "url": "http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-tyne-44457881"}, {"title": "Artist behind suspected Banksy in Birmingham revealed", "text": "Video\n\nA mural which has appeared on a wall in Birmingham was a tribute to teen artist Tame, the artist behind it has revealed.\n\nThere was speculation that the artwork on Floodgate Street, in Digbeth, was the work of elusive street artist Banksy.\n\nBut the man behind it said he wanted to honour his best friend, who died in 2013.", "authors": [], "url": "http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-stoke-staffordshire-44773584"}, {"title": "Exoskeleton that allows humans to work and play for longer", "text": "Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Would exoskeletons allow people to achieve previously undreamt of physical feats?\n\nWould you put on an exoskeleton that meant you could run for an entire day without getting tired?\n\nWhat about one that would allow you to stay on your feet longer at work?\n\nThe technology to give people superhuman strength is currently being developed but the ethical questions about whether we should be developing it and in what circumstances it should be used, are only just beginning to be asked.\n\nAn exoskeleton, as the name suggests, is an external frame that can be worn to support the body, either to help a person overcome an injury or to enhance their biological capacities. Powered by a system of electric motors, the frame gives limbs extra movement, strength and endurance.\n\nAt the Massachusetts Institute of Technology's Biomechatronics Lab, researchers are working on exoskeletons that will work in far better harmony with the body.\n\nPerfect pianist\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption Could technology create a superhuman pianist?\n\nPhD student Tyler Clites posed the scenario of a piano player who has developed arthritis.\n\nIn considering how technology could help this person regain their skills, he started asking if he could go even further.\n\n\"Why not go from a B piano player to an A++ piano player and be someone who can reach keys or create new types of sound patterns that no human has ever created before?\" he asked the BBC on a visit to the lab\n\n\"I find it very interesting that often as humans we are satisfied with where we are, with some baseline that we have set arbitrarily.\"\n\nImage copyright Biomechatronics group Image caption The lab aims to make exoskeletons that work in harmony with the body\n\nUsing a technique they call neuro-embodied design, Mr Clites's team is finding ways of extending the human nervous system into the synthetic world and vice versa.\n\nAt the centre of the laboratory is a treadmill fitted with devices that measure how much force is used when people walk or run. Above it are motion-capture cameras that work out exactly how people move their joints and muscles.\n\nThe data helps them design a system to help people run or walk faster or more efficiently.\n\nRunning for ever\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption Today's exoskeletons are bulky but could be made far more compact, say researchers\n\nThe students want to push the boundaries of technology behind what our current biological frames will allow.

We need ethical design from the start and I would design exoskeletons that switch themselves off after six hours.\"\n\nHowever, Mr Clites does not want to limit the technology. \"We don't stop building cars because some people will drive drunk,\" he told the BBC.\n\n\"We look at technology and think that if the benefits outweigh the risk for people to abuse it, then we are excited to go after the technology.\"\n\nCyborg ambitions\n\nImage copyright MIT Image caption Prof Hugh Herr believes we're entering a new era of human-machine interoperability\n\nProf Herr, is a self-described \"bionic man\", thanks to the robotic legs designed by his team, following a mountain climbing accident in his teens that left him as a double amputee.\n\nHis legs have been through many iterations to get to their current hi-tech standard.\n\n\"When I think about moving my legs, neural signals from my central nervous system pass through my nerves and activate muscles within my residual limbs,\" he explained in a TED talk earlier this year.\n\n\"Artificial electrodes sense these signals, and small computers in the bionic limb decode my nerve pulses into my intended movement patterns.\"\n\nBut he added, he is \"not yet a cyborg\".\n\nHis friend - Jim Ewing - who also lost his lower leg in a climbing accident - had his damaged limb rebuilt by a team of surgeons, scientists and engineers assembled at MIT called Team Cyborg.\n\nSurgeons connected muscles in his remaining leg in a way that allowed the nerves within them to continue sending information to the brain, helping his bionic foot work more naturally.\n\nThe engineers built the prosthetic to enable two-way communication, with signals travelling from his brain to his residual lower leg and into the bionic limb.\n\nImage copyright TED Image caption Jim Ewing's bionic leg enabled him to climb again\n\nIt allowed Mr Ewing to again climb the mountain in the Cayman Islands where he had fallen but that is just the start of the journey, thinks Prof Herr.\n\n\"I believe that the reach of neuro-embodied design will extend far beyond limb replacement and carry humanity into realms that will fundamentally redefine human potential,\" he said in his TED talk.\n\n\"In this 21st Century, designers will extend the nervous system into powerfully strong exoskeletons that humans can control and feel with their minds.\"\n\nListen to BBC World Service Business Daily on the issue of augmented humans", "authors": ["Jane Wakefield", "Technology Reporter"], "url": "http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-44628872"}, {"title": "who's made the song of the summer?", "text": "Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Dua Lipa, George Ezra and Cardi B are all contenders for the song of the summer\n\nMusic sounds better in the sunshine. There's no scientific evidence for that, but it's a fact.\n\nAnd with the UK in the middle of a heatwave, it's time to indulge in one of music's purest pleasures - the summer song.\n\nWhether it's frothy and euphoric or laid-back and relaxed, every year produces one song that defines the season.\n\nLast year, it was Luis Fonsi's Despacito. The year before it was Drake's One Dance. But who will take the crown in 2018?\n\nWe asked some of BBC Music's experts to select the song that's soundtracking their barbecues, pool parties and road trips.\n\nGeorge Ezra - Shotgun\n\nMark Savage, BBC Music reporter: What better way to soundtrack the summer than a song about a road trip to the beach? George Ezra's bouncy, carefree Shotgun has lyrics about \"bikini bottoms and lager tops\" and, for bonus sunbeams, resurrects the fretless bass sound of Paul Simon's Graceland. It's already number one, and it looks set to stay there.

The nostalgic, washed-out vibe is reminiscent of 90s dance music, but it also has the commercial appeal, which means it can be played everywhere.

Gary Lightbody opens up", "text": "Image copyright Polydor Records Image caption Snow Patrol formed in Northern Ireland in 1994\n\nGary Lightbody battled depression and alcoholism as Snow Patrol wrote their seventh album, Wildness. The band's frontman tells the BBC about overcoming his demons, how Nick Cave helped him conquer writer's block, and why he and Ed Sheeran want matching tattoos.\n\nSeven years. 2,555 days. That's how long it took Snow Patrol to make their new album.\n\nIn the same time, you could have trained to be a doctor, launched a spacecraft to Saturn or filmed six series of Game of Thrones.\n\nBut Gary Lightbody was engaged in a much more serious pursuit - conquering a life-threatening addiction to alcohol.\n\n\"I was relying on booze to get me through the day, every day\" he recalls.\n\n\"I'd started drinking on my own when I couldn't find anybody to go out with. The fun element disappeared pretty rapidly, and I was just doing it out of compulsion.\n\n\"Then it starts to affect not just your health but your temper - I had a really short fuse - and your mental health. All sorts of things.\"\n\nCrucially, it affected his ability to write and perform.\n\n\"Some people write well on booze. I didn't ever,\" he says. \"I'd only ever cough up hairballs.\n\n\"There were plenty of times I thought, 'Well maybe that's it - I've written all my songs.'\"\n\nImage copyright EPA Image caption The band will tour the US with Ed Sheeran this summer\n\nWhile his Snow Patrol bandmate Johnny McDaid was off writing hits with Ed Sheeran and Rudimental, Lightbody's condition worsened.\n\nThings reached crisis point in June 2016, when he was diagnosed with infections in his sinuses, eyes and ears - a result of sustained alcohol abuse.\n\nA doctor told him he had to stop drinking or he'd die - so he resolved to give it up for a month. Two years later, the 41-year-old is still sober. But it hasn't been easy.\n\nGetting clean forced him to focus on his mental health, triggering a \"wave of self-hatred\" that further exacerbated his inability to write.\n\nThe breakthrough finally came when he heard Nick Cave's harrowing album Skeleton Tree, recorded in the aftermath of his teenage son's death.\n\n\"The first track on it is called Jesus Alone,\" says Lightbody. \"It's a very intense piece of music about a very dark thing that happened to him, and I think I listened to it 10 times in a row. Our producer, Garrett Jacknife Lee, put it on in the studio and I just kept saying, 'again, again'.\n\n\"Garrett went to get some lunch and when he came back half an hour later, I'd written A Youth Written In Fire, start to finish.\n\n\"That whole song just came out. Whatever the vibration was in that Nick Cave song, it just rattled it out of me. It just shook loose what I'd been struggling desperately to shake for such a long time.\"\n\nA Youth Written In Fire traverses the peaks and troughs of Lightbody's drinking years, steering the singer towards the resolution: \"Those days are someone else's life.\"\n\nAfter that, the songs came flooding out, and the story of the last seven years is written in their titles: Heal Me, Don't Give In, What If This Is All The Love You Ever Get?\n\n\"I realised I can't pull back any more. These things I'm so afraid of? I have to start writing about them,\" says Lightbody.\n\n\"It helped me get through a lot of the things I've struggled with my whole life. It wasn't intentional therapy but it became therapeutic to do it.\"\n\nHaving unlocked his creativity, Lightbody was determined to push himself musically. The result is Wildness, Snow Patrol's most musically daring album since their 2003 breakthrough, Final Straw.\n\nThe fantastic first track, Life On Earth, opens quietly but builds to a triumphant chorus, while the carefree Wild Horses surges forward on a supple guitar loop.\n\nLightbody pushes his voice into new territories - even surprising himself with the fractured, falsetto rasp he produced on the first single, Don't Give In.\n\n\"It is at the very, very top of my range and it's a supreme effort to sing it every night,\" he says.\n\n\"But in the studio, for some reason, it seemed to come very naturally... Although the raspiness comes from the fact I had a cold.\"\n\nInitially, Lightbody planned to re-record those snot-infused vocals, but then his goddaughter Esme got wind of the plan.\n\n\"She came in and went, 'Don't you dare!'\" he recalls.\n\n\"She threatened she'd never speak to me again if I changed it - so I left it the way it was, I'm glad I did.\"\n\nLightbody's family shaped the album in a much more personal way on Soon, a heartbreaking message to Lightbody's father, who is suffering from dementia.\n\nIt's accompanied by a tender video in which father and son sit together and watch old home movies, an experience that was as moving to film as it is to watch.\n\n\"It was just a very sweet series of moments,\" he says. \"I'd be singing the song and he'd reach over and go, 'That's lovely, that is. That's a lovely song.'\"\n\nHe continues: \"His condition, of course, is devastating but within it, there are these moments of humour.\n\n\"Sometimes he'll say, 'What are we doing later?' and mum will say, 'I've already told you, we're doing this'. And then my dad says, 'You do know I've got dementia!'\n\n\"So he's very aware of it in a lot of ways. He makes jokes about it. He's doing his best.\"\n\nLike a lot of the songs on Wildness, Soon offers hope and acceptance in the place of melancholy and self-pity. It's no surprise to learn the Lightbody family motto, displayed proudly on the walls of the singer's childhood home, is Clarior E Tenebris - light after the dark.\n\n\"That motto definitely sunk in,\" says the star. \"I thought about it a lot, even in the times when I did not feel there was going to be brightness after the darkness.\n\n\"But that was really the crux of the whole thing, opening up yourself and letting the light shine in. Which is really what the whole record's about in a lot of ways.\"\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption The star still lives in his hometown of Bangor, Northern Ireland\n\nLater this summer, the band will get to play the songs in stadiums across the US, where they're supporting Ed Sheeran on his gargantuan \u00f7 tour.\n\nThe ginger wonder is repaying a favour, after Snow Patrol took him out on tour at the start of his career - although there might be some tension over an unfulfilled promise.\n\n\"When we first met, Ed had just started getting some tattoos,\" the singer explains. \"And I said, 'The only tattoo I've ever thought of getting is a line from a Bon Iver song.'\n\n\"Before I could say anything else, Ed went, 'Everything that happens is from now on,' and I was like, 'Yes! That's the line!'\n\n\"And then Ed went and got [Bon Iver frontman] Justin Vernon to write it down. He sent it to me and said, 'I'm getting this done as a tattoo tomorrow, go and get yours done, too'. But I chickened out.\n\n\"I've never had a tattoo. But I might get it done one day. I probably should, to complete the story.\"\n\nIn the seven years since then, Ed has become one of the world's most popular stars - but he still has some way to go before he can beat the success of Snow Patrol's biggest song, Chasing Cars, which has spent 166 weeks on the UK chart.\n\nThat makes it the second most successful song of the 2000s, after The Killers' Mr Brightside.\n\n\"I didn't know that stat,\" marvels Lightbody. \"I'm pretty flabbergasted by it.\n\n\"I still have a really deep relationship to that song. The way it unifies an audience is the thing I most cherish about it.\n\n\"It's a beautiful moment every time you play it.\"\n\nThe singer once declared that the best song ever written in Northern Ireland was The Teddy Bears Picnic... But based on its chart performance, I wonder whether Chasing Cars can rightfully claim the title?\n\n\"Bloody hell! Did I really say that?\" laughs Lightbody. \"No. The greatest song ever written in Northern Ireland is Teenage Kicks. Or about 25 Van Morrison songs.\n\n\"Although Teddy Bear's Picnic is a cracking tune....\"\n\nSnow Patrol's new single Empress is out now.\n\nFollow us on Facebook, on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts, or on Instagram at bbcnewsents.

When it\u2019s nobody else\u2019s business\n\nNo one needs to know about our embarrassing habits and private quirks unless we want them to. You might be a secret Jedward fan, perhaps you dance a Tudor jig each morning when you get up, or maybe you\u2019re irrationally afraid of mushrooms. Whatever your idiosyncrasies, as long as they\u2019re not harming anyone they\u2019re no one\u2019s business but your own.\n\n2. When a friend tells you something in confidence\n\nIf we agree to keep information private for a friend, it\u2019s a good idea to stay true to our word. Breaking a friend\u2019s trust by telling others their secrets can damage your relationship forever. What\u2019s worse is that even if you only tell one person, once the secret\u2019s out of your hands you can\u2019t stop it spreading.\n\nThis idea was illustrated particularly publicly when JK Rowling\u2019s crime writing alias Robert Galbraith was revealed on Twitter in 2013. The closely guarded secret had only been known to \u2018a handful\u2019 of people. But when one of Rowling\u2019s lawyers let it slip to his wife\u2019s best friend, it wasn\u2019t long before the world knew.", "authors": [], "url": "http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/articles/4jG52wTTywtfVFwjsmqyHXD/seven-times-when-it-s-ok-to-keep-a-secret"}, {"title": "Pucker up for the most memorable on-screen kisses", "text": "In the words of Lorraine McFly (Lea Thompson): \"This is all wrong.\" And we couldn\u2019t agree more.

Political crisis, corruption, recession, impeachment and austerity measures - it all happened in a matter of months.\n\n\"From boom to bust\" is how Brazil is often described in financial pages. Eike Batista's personal story follows roughly the same timeline.\n\nInspiration\n\nAt the height of his powers Eike Batista was an impressive businessman who amassed a fortune in mining with hard work, charm and the right connections in the business world.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption Eike Batista with girlfriend Flavia Sampaio in happier times in 2009 at at charity gala after his divorce from Luma de Oliveira\n\nBatista went to university in Germany where he also worked as a door-to-door salesman of insurance policies. But when he read in a magazine about a gold rush in the central region of Brazil, he dropped out of school and moved back to his home country.\n\nBatista borrowed money from jewellery makers in Rio de Janeiro and Sao Paulo and bought a gold mine in Brazil, which made him his first million dollars.\n\nThroughout the 1980s Batista expanded his business and went into partnership with global mining players such as Rio Tinto.\n\nHe was also making headlines elsewhere. Batista married Luma de Oliveira, one of the country's most beloved top models and Carnival queens, who had also won international powerboat racing competitions.\n\nBut it was during the 2000s that Batista reached the peak of his popularity - also when Brazil was beginning to emerge economically.\n\nBy then he had created his \"X\" empire - all companies in the conglomerate had the letter which is a symbol for multiplication.\n\nIn 2012 Eike Batista was listed by Forbes magazine as the seventh richest person in the world, with a personal fortune of $35bn and inspired a generation of young entrepreneurs.\n\nDownfall\n\nIt took 30 years for Batista to reach the top of Brazil's corporate world. But his downfall was much quicker.\n\nImage copyright AFP Image caption Eike Batista onstage with former Brazilian President Dilma Rousseff, who herself was later impeached and separately faced charges of corruption\n\nBy 2013 his companies were already in financial trouble. Batista had charmed many investors to get involved in complicated and expensive infrastructure, mining and oil projects.\n\nBut the oil wells he had bought were not producing enough barrels. Construction projects were delayed. And expected returns turned into financial losses.\n\nHe sold his companies, his yacht and much of his real estate in Rio de Janeiro and vowed to save his companies.\n\nCorruption\n\nBut his empire was built with something more sinister than just hard work and courage, according to investigators.\n\nIn 2017 Operation Car Wash - a wide investigation that revealed corruption in all major Brazilian political parties - revealed that Eike Batista used his connections with officials in Rio de Janeiro state to obtain public contracts.\n\nA judge issued an arrest warrant while Batista was in New York. There was speculation that he might flee, but Batista booked himself a first-class flight to Rio de Janeiro, where he gave himself up.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption Businessman Eike Batista arrives at Instituto Medico Legal for exams after being arrested at International Airport Gale\u00e3o on January 30, 2017\n\nEven in New York's airport, fellow Brazilians showed support and admiration and asked for selfies with the disgraced tycoon. Within hours he was in a prison cell with other common criminals with only a squat toilet and cold water. Not having completed college, he did not have a right to a special cell.\n\nHe remains the second only top 10 Forbes billionaires to be arrested - after drug trafficker Pablo Escobar.\n\nBatista's time in prison lasted only a few months and he was released to serve house arrest while awaiting trial.\n\nThis week a judge sentenced him to 30 years in jail for allegedly paying $16.5m to former Rio de Janeiro governor Sergio Cabral - whose combined prison sentences for corruption add up to 123 years in jail.\n\n\"His crimes caused deep scars in the trust of investors and entrepreneurs who, in the recent past, saw Brazil as a good investment option\", read the prison sentence given by Judge Marcelo Bretas in a criminal court in Rio.\n\nImage copyright EPA Image caption Eike Batista was once Brazil's richest billionaire\n\nEnd of the road\n\nJust a few years ago Batista had been hailed by then Brazilian President Dilma Rousseff as \"a standard, a national pride\" amongst Brazilian capitalists.\n\nEike Batista has been trying to reinvent himself as a YouTuber, with business tips on commodities and infrastructure.\n\nBut this week's conviction will most likely be the end of the road for a man who once embodied a national dream of wealth and prosperity.\n\nMeanwhile Brazil itself is struggling too to find a new path to growth. The country boomed during a golden global era of commodities but failed in its task of reforming its economy.\n\nBut Operation Car Wash shows one part of the system is slowly being reformed: authorities are tackling corporate corruption.

But his talent as a painter has been forgotten.\n\nHenry Wood painting in Scotland, 1938\n\nWood was not only a genius with the baton but a dab hand with the paintbrush. Music may have been his profession, but art was a lifetime hobby.\n\nNever known for his modesty he recalled that, as a schoolboy, he 'carried off every prize for painting, drawing and music'.\n\nBy the age of 12 he was giving concerts on the organ, but a year earlier in 1880 he produced this accomplished still life of apples.\n\nApples 1880\n\nThe picture he painted of himself in his autobiography was not always accurate. He claimed to have entered the Royal Academy of Music when he was 14 when in fact he was 3 years older. He also said he studied art under the greatest teachers at the Slade School of Fine Art \u2013 there is no record of his attendance there, although he did take some classes at Heatherley Art School.\n\nWhat isn\u2019t in doubt is his status as Britain\u2019s first celebrity conductor. While many of his predecessors had been sedate to the point of invisibility, Wood, with his beard and unruly mane of black hair, was a bundle of energy on the podium. His fame grew with the popularity of the Promenade concerts which he dominated for half a century.\n\nSir Henry Wood (1869\u20131944), in the Queen's Hall c.1920\n\nWood often compared the various instruments of an orchestra to a palette of colours : 'What after all is music but a picture? When I conduct Bach\u2019s Matthew Passion I see in my mind\u2019s eye Rembrandt\u2019s \u2018Descent from the Cross\u2019 from which I have learned more than even the words of the passion can tell me.'\n\nWherever he travelled in the world, Wood always took his painting equipment with him.\n\nOne of Sir Henry Wood's palettes\n\nHe was particularly proud of his image of the Eiger. 'I cannot tell you,' he wrote to his daughter Tania, 'the inner joy and satisfaction looking at the Eiger, for four or five mornings, gave me \u2013 it is a living and lifelong experience.'\n\nThe Eiger, near Murren 1931\n\nHis approach to music was more adventurous than his art which was solidly representational \u2013 not unlike the paintings of his near contemporary Sir Winston Churchill. While in music Wood embraced the avant-garde, promoting composers such as Bart\u00f3k, Stravinsky and Poulenc (another amateur painter) he expressed disgust in 1910 at the groundbreaking London exhibition of Post-Impressionist art which introduced such painters as Cezanne, Van Gogh and Gauguin to the British public.\n\nThree Tahitians 1899\n\nWood had by this time achieved some recognition as a painter. When in 1911 he staged an exhibition of 50 oil sketches at the Piccadilly Arcade Gallery he was pictured on the front page of the Daily Mirror in his painter\u2019s smock. The show raised the equivalent of \u00a315,000 for retired orchestral musicians.\n\nAway from London, Wood spent much of his time with his second wife Muriel and their two daughters at their house at Chorleywood in Hertfordshire. When he wasn\u2019t painting he was often to be found in a barn where he had a carpentry workshop. He also played tennis, very badly.\n\nA Garden Landscape, Chorleywood c.1936\n\nThe family was torn apart when Wood went off with the recently widowed Jessie Linton who had been one of his singing pupils. When Muriel refused a divorce Jessie changed her name by deed poll to \u2018Lady\u2019 Jessie Wood leading many to believe that she had become Sir Henry\u2019s wife.\n\nBust of Sir Henry Wood by Sir Donald Gilbert\n\nJessie, who outlived Wood by 34 years, did much to preserve his legacy. She bequeathed several of his paintings to the Royal Academy of Music, as well as the famous bronze bust by Sir Donald Gilbert that sits in front of the organ during the Proms and is garlanded by promenaders on the last night. For the remainder of the year it sits in the Academy\u2019s Duke\u2019s Hall where Sir Henry trained the student orchestra for many years.\n\nUntil now the paintings have been more or less forgotten but, as the Proms get underway for another season, it\u2019s worth remembering that Sir Henry Wood was an artist in more ways than one.", "authors": [], "url": "https://artuk.org/discover/stories/an-artist-in-more-ways-than-one-the-paintings-of-sir-henry-wood"}, {"title": "Rediscovering Rembrandt: How the British rescued the master", "text": "When Rembrandt van Rijn died, aged 63, lonely, bankrupt and neglected, there was little sign that he\u2019d become such a central figure in the history of European art.

Unable to pay his bills, he\u2019d been evicted from his home and studio.\n\nThe nation where this revival started wasn\u2019t his native Netherlands but Great Britain.\n\nYet today he\u2019s universally revered. What happened? Well, since his death, in 1669, his reputation has grown and grown, and the nation where this revival started wasn\u2019t his native Netherlands but Great Britain.\n\nRembrandt \u2013 Britain\u2019s Discovery of The Master at the Scottish National Gallery tells the story of this renaissance. It begins with one of his acute self-portraits \u2013 his first work to leave the Netherlands when it was given to Charles I in 1633. It ends with gutsy works by Frank Auerbach and Leon Kossoff, two of the many British artists he\u2019s inspired.\n\nWhat drove this reappraisal? As usual, a big factor was money. Rembrandt\u2019s career coincided with Holland\u2019s Golden Age, an era of commercial prowess. Yet in the 18th Century Dutch fortunes dwindled while the British economy took off. Now Dutch paintings were cheap and British toffs had cash to burn. Built by Robert Adam, their new mansions had lots of wall space.

According to EU statistics, the EU's trade surplus in 2017 was $140bn (\u20ac120bn; \u00a3106bn).\n\nOn Nato, President Trump's main objection is that a number of member states have not increased their defence budgets to the target of 2% of economic output.\n\nNato countries have agreed to raise military spending by 2024, although Germany and Spain are unlikely to meet the target.", "authors": [], "url": "https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-44780489"}, {"title": "BBC News", "text": "Trump told to appreciate allies on Nato trip\n\nAs he arrives for a Nato summit, the US president gets a stark warning from the European Council head.", "authors": ["Katya Adler", "Europe Editor"], "url": "https://www.bbc.com/news/world/europe"}, {"title": "Trump pardons Oregon ranchers who sparked 2016 militia standoff", "text": "Image copyright Police handout Image caption Dwight Hammond, 76, and his son Steven, 49\n\nPresident Donald Trump has pardoned two Oregon cattle ranchers whose sentence for arson led armed militiamen to seize control of a wildlife refuge in 2016.\n\nDwight Hammond, 76, and his son Steven Hammond, 49, were convicted in 2012 after a prescribed burn on their land spread to nearby public lands in 2001.\n\nThe pair served time in jail, but a judge later ruled that they must serve their full five-year sentence.\n\nThe ruling sparked anti-government protests that left one rancher dead.\n\n\"The Hammonds are devoted family men, respected contributors to their local community and have widespread support from their neighbours, local law enforcement and farmers and ranchers across the West,\" the White House said in statement on Tuesday announcing their full pardon.\n\n\"Justice is overdue for Dwight and Steven Hammond, both of whom are entirely deserving of these Grants of Executive Clemency.''\n\nThe Hammonds had claimed that the fire was to fend off invasive species, but prosecutors alleged that it was set to cover up evidence of illegal deer poaching and that it posed a grave risk to firefighters.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images\n\nA judge had granted them a shortened jail stint, but in 2015 a federal judge ruled that they must complete their full sentences and sent them back to jail.\n\nThe case had drawn the attention of limited-government proponents, including the family of Nevada rancher Cliven Bundy who was himself facing charges relating to an armed standoff with law enforcement stemming from a refusal to pay fees for grazing on public lands.\n\nHis son, Ammon Bundy, then began a social media campaign backing the Hammonds, and travelled to Burns, Oregon, to organise protests calling for their release.\n\nMr Bundy and his group, Citizens for Constitutional Freedom, attracted supporters from across a number of states.\n\nOn 2 January 2016 the armed militiamen - who were never directly endorsed by the Hammonds - took over the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge and widened the range of demands.\n\nThe standoff ended when police arrested several members and fatally shot the group's spokesman, LaVoy Finicum, who they said was reaching for his gun during a traffic stop.\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Why did militiamen stage a protest in Oregon?\n\nPardon power\n\nAnthony Zurcher, BBC News, Washington\n\nIt's not going to get as much attention as the pardons of Arizona Sheriff Joe Arpaio, Bush administration official Scooter Libby or conservative provocateur Dinesh D'Souza, but Mr Trump's recent move sends a clear message to those who are watching.\n\nThe president stands with right-wing militias in their disputes with the government.\n\nIn the vast stretches of federal territory in the western US, ranchers and government land management officials frequently clash. In the Hammond case, repeated skirmishes and antagonisms ended in arrest and boiled over into a protracted armed standoff that became a rallying cry for the conservative political fringe.\n\nThe Obama administration insisted the Hammonds receive a mandatory minimum sentence of five years - but Mr Trump has other ideas. While the president and his administration may espouse rigorous enforcement of the law in other areas, in this case they insist that a vigorous prosecution was unwarranted.\n\nWhat's more, the president, once again, has shown he is willing to use his pardon power to address what he sees political wrongs. That's a message interested parties - perhaps those in the crosshairs of Robert Mueller's special counsel investigation - won't miss, either.\n\nSusie Hammond, Dwight's wife and Steven's mother, told the Oregonian that she was asleep when her local congressman called to say that Mr Trump had signed the pardon.\n\n\"We've been waiting a long time. I think it's wonderful,\" she said, adding: \"I still can't believe it.

Previously it only put out growth data every three months.\n\nIn the three months to May, the economy grew by 0.2% compared with the previous three-month period.\n\n\"The first of our new rolling estimates of GDP shows a mixed picture of the UK economy with modest growth driven by the services sector, partly offset by falling construction and industrial output,\" said the ONS's head of national accounts, Rob Kent-Smith.\n\n\"Retailing, computer programming and legal services all performed strongly in the three months to May, while housebuilding and manufacturing both contracted.\n\n\"Services, in particular, grew robustly in May, with retailers enjoying a double boost from the warm weather and the royal wedding. Construction also saw a return to growth after a weak couple of months.\"\n\nIan Stewart, chief economist at Deloitte, said: \"The long awaited bounce-back from a weak first quarter has failed to materialise, with the rolling three-month growth rate unchanged into May.\n\nHe added: \"The fact that first-half growth is set to be below trend hardly makes a compelling case for an August rate rise.\"\n\nHowever, Samuel Tombs, chief UK economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, said the upturn in May was \"just strong enough to tip the balance\" in favour of an August rate rise, \"provided the government doesn't implode before then\".\n\nAnalysis:\n\nKamal Ahmed, BBC economics editor\n\nGetting a little better, pretty slowly. Today's economic growth figures for May reveal that the \"bounce-back\" from the weather-related misery of the first three months of the year is small, though not insignificant.\n\nThe services sector - which accounts for 80% of our economy - is stronger. Construction activity was also up by 2.9% compared with the previous month - although we must always take care with monthly figures, which can tend to be volatile.\n\nThis morning's retail sales figures from the British Retail Consortium also revealed a pick-up. We are all doing a bit more shopping.\n\nThe royal wedding and sunny weather are doing their bit now, in the way the snow and frost depressed February and March.\n\nThere is little in today's figures that will surprise the Bank of England, which is contemplating increasing interest rates next month. It predicted a \"bounce-back\" earlier in the year.\n\nAnd against a subdued background, there is evidence today that is happening.\n\nOther figures also released by the ONS showed:\n\nThe country's total trade deficit widened by \u00a35bn to \u00a38.3bn in the three months to May, mainly because of falling goods exports and rising goods imports\n\nServices output increased by 0.4% in the three months to May compared with the previous three months\n\nConstruction output fell by 1.7% in the three months to May, but rose 2.9% in May compared with April\n\nProduction fell by 0.6% in the three months to May compared with the previous three months, because of a fall of 1.2% in manufacturing.\n\nWhy have the UK's GDP statistics changed?\n\nBasically, in an effort to make them more reliable.\n\nUntil now, the ONS used to release a preliminary estimate of GDP four times a year.\n\nBut this early quarterly estimate was based on about 40% of the information necessary to produce a full estimate of GDP, so it was subject to change as more data came in.\n\nThe new policy should mean that the figures do not need to be revised as much in subsequent months.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images\n\nHow have the statisticians managed to do this?\n\nThe ONS's new monthly and rolling three-monthly estimates will be compiled with what it calls \"a significantly higher data content\".\n\nThe office says it has spent money on upgrading its systems so that it can gather and analyse information in a more timely fashion.\n\nIn particular, the service sector, which contributes 80% of the UK's GDP, will now be measured more speedily than before, it says.\n\nWhat are the advantages and disadvantages of the change?\n\nIt will bring the UK more into line with other developed economies, which tend to produce more accurate initial quarterly estimates that don't need such big revisions.\n\nIn fact, the ONS intends to leapfrog other countries, by making the UK the first big economy to produce a monthly figure.\n\nHowever, in the short term, it could be bad news for one of the ONS's biggest customers, the Bank of England.\n\nThe Bank's interest rate-setting Monetary Policy Committee is due to meet on 2 August, amid speculation that it could raise rates by a quarter of a percentage point to 0.75%.\n\nUnder the old timetable for release of GDP figures, MPC members would have been armed with a preliminary estimate of second-quarter growth. But now those figures will not be available until 10 August.\n\nThe ONS says those figures will be more comprehensive and accurate because of the delay.

holiday the venue staff were adamant that I couldn't bring in some biscuits and a can of coke, I was showing them my insulin, my blood monitor, but they were relentless.\n\n\"I've been to countless places where I've had my bag searched and people have said 'you're not allowed to take drinks in' and you really have to explain they're there not there just because I want to consume them, they're there as a medical necessity.\n\n\"As a diabetic, it is frustrating because if I am not allowed to bring a sugary drink into a venue, it means I have to pay their inflated prices.\n\n\"Taking a hypo (a fall in blood sugar level) at something like a gig or concert could be as serious as life or death.\"\n\nDiabetes\n\nThere are two main types of diabetes:\n\nType 1 - where the pancreas does not produce any insulin\n\nType 2 - where the pancreas does not produce enough insulin or the body's cells do not react to insulin\n\nType 1 diabetes can develop at any age, but usually appears before the age of 40, particularly in childhood.\n\nAbout 10% of all diabetes is type 1, but it is the most common type of childhood diabetes, so it is sometimes called juvenile diabetes or early onset diabetes\n\nType 2 diabetes tends to develop later in life and is often linked to lifestyle and being overweight or having a family history of type 2 diabetes.\n\nSource: NHS Choices", "authors": [],

sweets have become the first companies to have online adverts banned under new rules targeting junk food ads for children.\n\nThe Advertising Standards Authority said the companies did not do enough to prevent under-16s seeing the content.\n\nNew rules governing children's advertising online came into force last July, adding to rules already in place for TV ads.\n\nThe adverts featured on the companies' websites, apps or social media.\n\nIn its ruling, ASA banned Cadbury's use of a storybook titled The Tale Of The Great Easter Bunny on its website, which featured children hunting for eggs.\n\nChewits had four Facebook posts banned which featured Chewie the Chewitsaurus in a number of campaigns.\n\nAnd a so-called advergame app called Squashies World, where players match pairs of Squashies by flicking them towards each other, was also banned.\n\nCaroline Cerny of the Obesity Health Alliance said: \"Whilst today's rulings should be celebrated, the complaints demonstrate the blatant ways in which the food and drink industry attempts to exploit loopholes in the rules.\"\n\nASA chief executive Guy Parker said: \"The ban on HFSS [high in fat, salt or sugar] ads in children's online media is working, but it's important that we enforce it rigorously.\n\n\"These rulings show that we're doing that and will help advertisers understand where we're drawing the line.\"\n\nMondelez, which owns Cadbury, said it would now \"build upon our longstanding commitment to not market directly to children under the age of 16\".\n\nSwizzels, which makes Squashies, said the advergame it created was not designed to appeal to children and did not \"in any way\" encourage children to eat sweets.\n\nChewits producer Cloetta said its Chewitsaurus was not \"developed to target under-16s\" and was instead targeted at \"parents and young adults\".\n\nSeparately, YouTube star Zoella and Pointless Blog, run by her partner Alfie Dayes, were not found to have broken the ASA rules, after advertising the confectionary brand Ferrero.\n\nThe body found reasonable steps had been taken to target ads appropriately, and only a small portion of the the channel's viewers were

"http://www.bbc.com/persian/institutional/2011/04/000001_links"}, {"title": "South Korea\u2019s unstoppable taste for haste", "text": "On a recent evening at Ttobagi Driver\u2019s Restaurant in Seoul\u2019s Gwanak District, I surreptitiously started a timer upon placing my order. The waitress strolled off in a leisurely fashion, returning with kimchi and other side dishes just two minutes and 20 seconds later. One and half minutes after that, a clay bowl of ppyeodagwi haejangguk (pork-spine \u2018hangover\u2019 soup) was set on the table, steaming furiously.\n\nIt\u2019s remarkable enough that such service exists in a country where tipping is not practiced. More remarkable still, though, is that Ttobagi, an unpretentious spot frequented by taxi drivers, is no faster than the next place.\n\nYou may also be interested in:\n\n\u2022 The world\u2019s most innovative economy?\n\n\u2022 Is Singapore suffering from FOMO?\n\n\u2022 A 3,000-year-old city that runs on AI\n\nRoutine speediness runs through South Korean society and is especially prevalent in the capital. There is even a term for it: ppalli-ppalli culture. Translating to \u2018fast\u2019 or \u2018hurry\u2019, ppalli is pronounced with a tensed first consonant, as if snapping the vocal apparatus like a rubber band.\n\nThe ppalli-ppalli tendency can be seen in South Korea\u2019s world-leading internet speeds, intensive language classes promising near-immediate results and popular speed-dating events. And just as time-conscious are the glitzy wedding halls that host a succession of hour-long ceremonies all weekend.\n\nPpalli-ppalli is also the watchword of the thousands of food delivery motorcyclists who bend the rules of traffic \u2013 and physics, too, it appears \u2013 to deliver their orders post-haste. To compete, McDonald\u2019s, the global leader in fast food, began assembling its own fleets of delivery scooters in South Korea in 2007.\n\nYet not long ago, Korea was a great deal slower due to its rural complexion. In 1960, a whopping 72% of the population lived in the countryside. So how did the people go from transplanting rice to downloading torrents in just a few decades?\n\nNaturalised Korean citizen Gary Rector, who arrived in Seoul as a Peace Corps volunteer in 1967, reflects, \u201cI remember being surprised because, before I came here, I had this stereotypical idea that they\u2019re going to be zenned-out, meditating and taking life slowly. And yet I found that people were often rushing around more than Americans would. The older people were slower, but people my age \u2013 and I was 24 years old \u2013 were very busy rushing around trying to improve their lifestyle.\u201d\n\nRector came during a time of intense change. In the early \u201960s, South Korea embarked upon a series of five-year economic plans put forward by then-president Park Chung-hee. These military-style campaigns brought about the Miracle on the Han River (the transformation from a war-ruined country to an economic powerhouse), and created Korea Inc, represented by such corporate behemoths as Samsung, Hyundai and LG.\n\nThe fruits of ppalli-ppalli are on proud display at the National Museum of Korean Contemporary History in central Seoul. Aptly, South Korea\u2019s spirit of urgent advancement can be said to have issued from this very building. Long before becoming a museum space, it housed both the Supreme Council for National Reconstruction and the Economic Planning Board.\n\nIn the exhibition hall covering 1961-1987, South Korea\u2019s period of explosive growth, I watched a young couple peer at the country\u2019s first piece of consumer electronics, the A-501 Radio, which was in fact made in 1959. Nearby, a father showed his son the boxy, cyan-blue Hyundai Pony, which first rolled off an assembly line in 1975.\n\nMind-bogglingly, the country\u2019s exports during this period grew by 30% to 40% per year. The boldness of the economic planners and the zeal of the workforce allowed the country to leapfrog from exporting raw silk and iron ore to making factory items like wigs and textiles. Then, learning on the fly, the nation graduated to consumer electronics, oil tankers and semiconductors.\n\nExpeditiousness is embedded deeply in [Koreans'] minds as a basic value\n\nAnthropologist Kim Choong-soon attributes much of South Korea\u2019s success as an exporter to the focus on speed. \u201cThe practice of ppalli-ppalli is not merely part of daily life for Koreans; expeditiousness is embedded deeply in their minds as a basic value,\u201d he writes in Way Back into Korea. \u201cThanks to this culture of hurry, [South] Korea was able to achieve tremendous economic progress and industrialisation in a very short period of time\u201d.\n\nThe defining symbol of ppalli-ppalli achievement remains the Gyeongbu Expressway, which runs 428km south-east from Seoul to the second city of Busan. Originally slated to take three and half years, the highway was completed just two years and five months after the 1968 ground-breaking ceremony. All told, about nine million man-days of labour were poured into the project.\n\nBy no means, though, has the speed of construction in South Korea tapered off since then. An entire cutting-edge city, Songdo International Business District, was erected on reclaimed land south-west of Seoul starting in 2004, with the first phase \u2013 comprising a sprawling park, convention centre, Sheraton hotel and set of apartment towers \u2013 opening just five years later. Even more ambitious \u2013 and faster \u2013 was the administrative centre of Sejong City, about 120km south of Seoul, which was built from scratch starting in 2010 and inaugurated in 2012.\n\nThough South Korea gets more recognition for its fleetness, North Korea seems to have the speed bug too. Kim Il-sung, the founding leader of North Korea, encouraged workers to aspire to \u2018chollima speed\u2019, referring to a mythical horse that flies around 400km per day.\n\nBut the Supreme Leader\u2019s grandson, Kim Jong-un, shifted up a few gears with the slogan \u2018mallima speed\u2019 \u2013 a 10-time increase. His sloganeering has borne some results, with showpiece apartment towers on Pyongyang\u2019s Ryomong Street opening in 2017 after only a year of construction.\n\nThis begs the question of whether the roots of ppalli-ppalli culture go deeper than the modern era. Kim wagers that they do. \u201cBuilding and construction in the historic past were also completed ahead of schedule,\u201d he writes, quoting the construction of Hwaseong in Suwon as an example. This grand fortress, recognised as a Unesco World Heritage site, was finished seven years early, in 1796, and remains in excellent condition.\n\nSimilarly, one wonders if the exquisite celadon of the Goryeo dynasty (918-1392) was created on the potter\u2019s wheel with the same efficiency that characterises Korean productions today. Manual dexterity and artistic mastery were certainly prized in the 16th Century, when the calligrapher Han Seok-bong painted Chinese characters in a range of scripts, including a vigorous cursive. Painting lines of poetry without lifting brush from paper requires absolute control \u2013 and speed.\n\nThough few South Koreans can wield a brush these days, many have developed extremely agile thumbs. The LG Mobile World Cup, a text-messaging competition, was won by the Korean team when it was held in New York in 2010. And it may be no coincidence that Korean Olympians have excelled at rapid-fire sports like archery and shooting. They have dominated most of all, though, at short-track speed skating, amassing a total of 48 Olympic medals to date.\n\nYet outside commentators sometimes overly rely on the idea of ppalli-ppalli when trying to explain Korea, notes Koo Se-woong, publisher of Korea Expos\u00e9, an independent media outlet specialising in the Korean Peninsula. \u201cIt\u2019s almost like a caricature of Korean culture,\u201d Koo said. \u201cI understand that there is an emphasis on speed here, but it\u2019s strange to see how that is distilled into this particular expression which is not even employed by Koreans themselves with any kind of frequency.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s almost like a caricature of Korean culture\n\nAnd while many Koreans have fully embraced the convenience of instant noodles and same-day parcel deliveries, others have rejected the hustle and bustle of city life. Numerous celebrities, for instance, have moved to the southern island of Jeju, which is much slower paced. These include pop diva Lee Hyori and her husband Lee Sang-soon, who showcased their bucolic lifestyle on the hit reality television show Hyori\u2019s Bed and Breakfast. But it is hard to predict how long the back-to-the-soil moment will last. Korean social trends, too, change with the blink of an eye.\n\nWhy We Are What We Are is a BBC Travel series examining the characteristics of a country and investigating whether they are true.\n\nJoin more than three million BBC Travel fans by liking us on Facebook, or follow us on Twitter and Instagram.\n\nIf you liked this story, sign up for the weekly bbc.com features newsletter called \"If You Only Read 6 Things This Week\".

Crawford"], "url": "http://www.bbc.com/travel/story/20180708-south-koreas-unstoppable-taste-for-haste"}, {"title": "The five countries that set world culture", "text": "Global influence is often measured by military, political or economic might, but for some countries, it\u2019s the strength of the culture \u2013 its food, fashion or entertainment \u2013 that most strongly impacts the wider world.\n\nThese culturally influential countries were recently ranked by U.S. News and World Report, based on factors like being perceived as prestigious, fashionable, trendy, happy, modern or culturally significant in terms of entertainment. While many of the top 10 countries were in Europe, including Italy, Spain, France and the UK, the list also included Japan (ranking high for being modern and prestigious), Brazil (for its happy populace and entertainment), and the United States (for being modern and culturally influential).\n\nWe spoke to residents in the five top-ranked countries, which exemplified these areas of cultural influence, to find out how their nation make a global impact and what it\u2019s like living in a place that defines the international cutting-edge.\n\nItaly\n\nFamous for designer brands like Valentino, Armani, Versace and Gucci, Italy scored a perfect 10 in being both \u2018fashionable\u2019 and \u2018trendy\u2019, which hardly surprises residents like Lucio Buffalmano, founder of the ThePowerMoves.com blog, who comes from Abruzzo, east of Rome. \u201cIt's a clich\u00e9, but Italians do care about what looks nice, and Italians do take more care than most in looking fashionable,\u201d he said.\n\nYou may also be interested in:\n\n\u2022 The best countries for entrepreneurs\n\n\u2022 Want to live in a well-run country?\n\n\u2022 The world\u2019s most adventurous countries\n\nBut this notorious attention to detail extends beyond fashion. \u201cItaly has a great impact in everything that has to do with style, from food to furniture,\u201d said Angela Corrias, originally from Sardinia but who now lives in Rome and blogs at Rome Actually.\n\nThe country\u2019s food of course claims an outsize influence. To experience the country\u2019s culinary influence first-hand, Corrias recommends heading to capital city Rome. \u201cThe financial crisis hit hard, but Romans will never give up on eating out,\u201d Corrias said. \u201cHere you can explore both the traditional flavours and recipes created with a modern twist. Porto restaurant in Prati area, for example, serves a seafood version of the traditional cacio e pepe (pasta seasoned with Roman pecorino cheese and black pepper), and while it might sound weird, the combination of cheese and seafood, it's actually delicious.\u201d\n\nOther interesting cultural destinations for expats include Bologna, also known for its rich gastronomical heritage, and Milan, which is the country\u2019s largest business and fashion hub but also has plenty of top-notch restaurants and a large, lively expat community.\n\nFrance\n\n\u2018Modern\u2019, \u2018prestigious\u2019 and \u2018fashionable\u2019 were all areas where France scored high, and the French \u2018je ne sais quoi\u2019 is something that people across the world try to imitate. Lifelong Paris resident Roobens Fils didn\u2019t even realise how influential his culture was until he travelled throughout the Middle East and Asia.\n\n\u201cPeople in very remote places love and are inspired by French food, French art and French fashion. I met people in Iran telling me how they loved Moli\u00e8re! I was shocked! They know Moli\u00e8re in Iran!\u201d said Fils, who blogs about his travels at Been Around the Globe.\n\nThough Paris is the obvious place to experience French culture, from fashion to food, Bordeaux, Lyon and Toulouse are excellent \u2013 and smaller \u2013 alternatives.\n\nThe French take extreme pride in their identity that has shaped the world\n\n\u201cBordeaux is a prestigious city, and a lot of good wine is produced in the area,\u201d Fils said. The city also has the most historical buildings in the country outside of Paris. Lyon, France\u2019s third most populous city, is well known for its culinary traditions and has produced a number of three-star Michelin chefs. Toulouse, the capital of France\u2019s southern Occitanie region, prides itself on its 2,000-plus-year history stretching back to the Visigoths and Romans and the accompanying pink terracotta architecture that gives it the nickname \u2018La Ville Rose\u2019.\n\nThe French take extreme pride in their identity that has shaped the world, and this includes the French language \u2013 which can be challenging for new expats. \u201cMost people in France don't speak English, or broken English. Sometimes they do speak English, they just don't want to,\u201d Fils said. \u201cAn expat will have to adapt to France, because French people won't make the effort to adapt to you.\u201d\n\nThe United States\n\nScoring highly for being \u2018modern\u2019 and \u2018influential in entertainment\u2019, the US\u2019 films, music and TV programmes are enjoyed globally. Even when another country does something first, like the reality TV genre that started in the UK, the US is known for making it bigger and more popular worldwide. The country\u2019s tech industry, home to Facebook, Twitter, Google and Amazon, has also left its mark, with billions of people interacting daily with these popular services and social networks.\n\nThis influential American identity is firmly rooted in the power of possibility and dreaming beyond humble beginnings. \u201cWe still believe in the \u2018American Dream\u2019 here, which is only possible in what was once a British colony of debtors, slaves, the religiously persecuted and the world\u2019s poor,\u201d said Andrew Selepak, a professor in the department of telecommunication at the University of Florida, and director of the graduate social media programme.\n\nNew York City, the country\u2019s largest city, exemplifies these values. The words of Frank Sinatra \u2013 \u201cIf I can make it there, I can make it anywhere\u201d \u2013 still apply to the Big Apple, also known as the city that never sleeps. On the opposite coast, Hollywood in Los Angeles produces the entertainment that shapes culture in the US and beyond. \u201cAmerican TV shows and movies made here influence how we talk, dress, what we watch, and who we are,\u201d Selepak said.\n\nBetween the two cities however, is a vast geography that spans oceans, deserts, farmland and mountains. And with more than 300 million residents, the country prides itself on its diversity. \u201cJust like our ethnic backgrounds, we all have different cultural upbringings and values,\u201d said Jon Salas, who lives in Boston and blogs at The Running Publicist. \u201cThe same rule applies to the country\u2019s geography. Depending on your personality and what you thrive on, your experience in the US will be different in every city you go to. Miami is not the same as Chicago, nor is New Orleans anything similar to New York City. Each city has been shaped by its history and its people. If you have an experience in one region that wasn\u2019t quite what you were looking for, then give another corner of the country a try.\u201d\n\nSpain\n\nOnce one of the world\u2019s largest conquerors and empires, Spain has left a lasting mark across geographies from South America to the East Indies. After Chinese, Spanish is the second most spoken language in the world when measured by native speakers, and the strength of its Spanish-speaking movies, TV and music helped push the country to the top.\n\n\u201cFrom the Spanish language to religion, cuisine, festivals and many other aspects, wherever I travel it is always pretty easy to find a bit of my country,\u201d said Inma Gregorio, who is from the Galicia region and blogs at A World To Travel.\n\nSpain\u2019s tapas culture is one that has spread internationally, but continues to connect people locally. \u201cFood here is a way of living,\u201d said Andre Arriaza, who lives in Barcelona and is the founder of Barcelona Eat Local Culinary Experiences. \u201cEating is sharing, either with a bunch of friends, or with all the strangers that are around you, whom always engage in chit-chat,\u201d he said.\n\nFood here is a way of living\n\nThis kind of socialising is key in a country that always puts family and friends before work, with long lunches (including the sobremesa) and family gatherings the norm. \u201cWe work to live, not otherwise,\u201d Gregorio said. \u201cEven during last year\u2019s [constitutional] crisis, bars were full day in and day out.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s a welcome change to expats like Cory Varga, a UK citizen who has lived in Seville for the past six months and blogs at You Could Travel. \u201cWe love living in Spain because everyone seems really relaxed. The attitude towards life is that it should be savoured and enjoyed.\u201d\n\nThis isn\u2019t easy for all expats, who must adjust to more easy-going schedules and late dinner starts. Knowing Spanish also makes life a bit easier for expats, but it\u2019s not a huge barrier; most cities have lots of Spanish language schools and residents will usually try and help. \u201cSpanish people are friendly,\u201d said Bernard Sury, originally from Brussels and currently lives in Valencia, and is the co-founder GuruWalk. \u201cEven if they don't understand you, they'll try to help you anyway.\u201d\n\nThe United Kingdom\n\nRanking high for the \u2018prestigious\u2019 label, UK residents take pride in their ability to combine a strong work ethic, creativity and an openness to change to produce new innovation. \u201cWe have some of the finest universities in the world, and an entrepreneurial flair,\u201d said London resident and author Ian Hawkins. \u201cDon\u2019t forget, machine code, the computer and www were all invented by Brits.\u201d\n\nThe influence and flexibility of the English language has allowed Britain to thrive as a place where people come to create a new future. \u201cOur language is rich in its borrowings from other languages, and generous in its acceptance of people learning it,\u201d Hawkins said. \u201cMy Venezuelan friend arrived in London 11 years ago with \u00a3700 in his pocket and no English. Today he\u2019s a business consultant and operates more than 30 restaurants and shops. Anyone can come to Britain and be as British as British can be. If you don\u2019t believe me, we can talk about it over curry.\u201d\n\nExpats should know that Brits don\u2019t always say what they mean, so you may need to read between the lines. \u201cIt is important to look for the nuances in language and body language,\u201d said Australian Amanda O\u2019Brien, who blogs at The Boutique Adventurer. \u201c\u2018I\u2019m not sure\u2019 often means \u2018no\u2019.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe English often mean the precise opposite of what they say,\u201d Hawkins added. \u201cIt\u2019s a language full of puns, double meanings and innuendos.\u201d\n\nAnyone can come to Britain and be as British as British can be\n\nAs the country\u2019s business and financial centre, London remains a top destination for working expats. Though the city suffers from a lack of affordable housing, its abundance of museums, concert venues and theatres provides just the right environment to keep residents at the cutting edge of culture.\n\n\u201cSamuel Johnson famously said \u2018When a man is tired of London, he is tired of life\u2019,\u201d said current resident Gregory Golinski, originally from Paris. \u201cI couldn't agree more. There are so many attractions here that you can choose to visit a different place every weekend; you don't have to do the same thing twice.\u201d\n\nBut the cutting edge doesn\u2019t end in in the capital. Edinburgh punches above its weight in terms of cultural influence, hosting the Fringe Festival, the world\u2019s largest arts festival, as well as being the \u2018birthplace\u2019 of Harry Potter. Birmingham in the heart of the country is another contender. \u201cFrom clubbing to orchestras, Birmingham has a fantastic culture,\u201d Hawkins said. \u201cFamously, the city has more canals than Venice, and the jewellery quarter is where cutting edge fashion meets traditional skills.\u201d\n\nJoin more than three million BBC Travel fans by liking us on Facebook, or follow us on Twitter and Instagram.\n\nIf you liked this story, sign up for the weekly bbc.com features newsletter called \"If You Only Read 6 Things This Week\".

It was late September, the end of the tourist season in a part of Iceland that sees about 6% the country\u2019s annual tourist numbers, and the roads were all but empty.\n\nThe van stalled twice more as my husband and I made the roughly 200km drive from L\u00e1trabjarg, a windswept bird cliff perched on the far western edge of Iceland, back to our base in \u00cdsafj\u00f6r\u00f0ur, the Westfjords\u2019 largest town (pop: 2,600). Once we finally got back to our apartment, we called the campervan rental company and told them the issue. Unfortunately, the town\u2019s mechanic wouldn\u2019t be available before we were due to make the drive back to Reykjavik.\n\n\u201cWell,\u201d said the campervan agent, \u201c\u00feetta reddast!\u201d\n\nYou may also be interested in:\n\n\u2022 The planet\u2019s most extreme cuisine?\n\n\u2022 The code that travellers need to learn\n\n\u2022 A strange life at the end of the world\n\nA quick Google search informed me that \u00feetta reddast (pronounced thet-ta red-ust) doesn\u2019t mean \u2018sorry, I\u2019m not paid enough to care about your troubles\u2019, or \u2018try not to get stranded in the middle of nowhere\u2019. It means \u2018it\u2019ll all work out in the end\u2019 \u2013 and if Iceland had an official slogan, this would be it. The phrase near-perfectly sums up the way Icelanders seem to approach life: with a laid-back, easy-going attitude and a great sense of humour.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just one of those ubiquitous phrases that is around you all the time, a life philosophy wafting through the air,\u201d said Alda Sigmundsd\u00f3ttir, author of several books about Iceland's history and culture. \u201cIt\u2019s generally used in a fairly flippant, upbeat manner. It can also be used to offer comfort, especially if the person doing the comforting doesn\u2019t quite know what to say. It\u2019s sort of a catch-all phrase that way.\u201d\n\nAt first glance, it seems an odd philosophy for a place where, for centuries, many things absolutely did not work out all right. Since Iceland\u2019s settlement in the 9th Century, its history is littered with the tales of times when \u00feetta reddast did not apply.\n\nIf Iceland had an official slogan, this would be it\n\nIn her book, The Little Book of the Icelanders in the Old Days, Sigmundsd\u00f3ttir recounts some of these hardships: the long winters; extreme poverty; indentured servitude. There were volcanic eruptions, like the 1783 Laki eruption that killed 20% of the 50,000-strong population, as well as 80% of its sheep, which were a vital food source in a country with little agriculture. There were storms that swept in and sank the open rowboats used for fishing, wiping out much of the male populations of entire towns. Things were so bad that even up through the 18th Century, according to Sigmundsd\u00f3ttir, 30% of babies died before they turned one.\n\nThe Iceland of old was an exceptionally hard place to live. And the Iceland of old wasn\u2019t that long ago. \u201cIt hasn\u2019t been that long since we were a society of farmers and fishermen, and the seasons and the harsh conditions we lived in had complete control over our lives,\u201d Au\u00f0ur \u00d6sp, founder and owner of I Heart Reykjavik tour company, told me.\n\nWhile Iceland today is an ultra-modern place where wi-fi is abundant, credit cards are accepted everywhere, and the majority of the country is powered by geothermal energy, it was only about 90 years ago that 50% of the population lived in turf houses (traditional homes with walls and roofs made of earth and grass) \u2013 so these hardships aren\u2019t such a distant memory. Just 45 years ago, the Eldfell volcano exploded on the small island of Heimaey, spewing millions of tons of ash, engulfing 400 buildings and forcing the evacuation of all 5,000 people who lived there. And just 23 years ago, a massive avalanche decimated the town of Flateyri in the Westfjords, burying more than a dozen homes and killing 20 of the town\u2019s 300 residents.\n\nEven on a day without disasters, Iceland is beholden to the forces of nature. The island moves and breathes in a way few others do; fumaroles exhale steam; hot springs gurgle; geysers belch and bubble; waterfalls thunder. The country sits on the rift between the North American and Eurasian tectonic plates, and those plates are slowly moving apart, widening Iceland by about 3cm per year and causing an average of 500 small earthquakes every week.\n\nIceland is beholden to the forces of nature\n\nThe country\u2019s weather is just as volatile and formidable. Windstorms can reach hurricane force, strong storms can sweep in even in summer, and, on the darkest winter days, the sun shines for just four hours.\n\n\u201cThose who live off the land are in constant battle with the elements,\u201d \u00d6sp said. \u201cFor example, when it suddenly starts to snow in August, like it happened in the north a few years ago, you need to drop everything and go out and rescue your animals. Or, when there\u2019s a volcanic eruption that disrupts flights all over the world and leaves a bunch of people stranded in Iceland, you need to think on your feet and figure out what to do.\u201d\n\nMaybe it makes sense, then, that in a place where people were \u2013 and still are \u2013 so often at the mercy of the weather, the land and the island\u2019s unique geological forces, they\u2019ve learned to give up control, leave things to fate and hope for the best. For these stoic and even-tempered Icelanders, \u00feetta reddast is less a starry-eyed refusal to deal with problems and more an admission that sometimes you must make the best of the hand you\u2019ve been dealt.\n\nThe phrase begins to be a little more understandable when you find out that the first Icelanders weren\u2019t marauding Vikings who bravely sailed across the ocean in search of new lands to raid and tribes to wage war upon. Rather, they were mostly Norwegian farmers and peasants fleeing slavery and death at the hands of King Harald Finehair in the 9th Century. They so feared his wrath that they risked the 1,500km journey across the rough North Atlantic seas in small open-hulled boats. It\u2019s hard to imagine those early settlers making the journey \u2013 one undertaken with no maps or navigational tools \u2013 without a little bit of blind hope.\n\n\u201cWe couldn\u2019t live in this environment without a certain level of conviction that things will work out somehow, hard as they seem in the moment,\u201d \u00d6sp said. \u201c\u00deedda redast represents a certain optimism that Icelanders have and this carefree attitude that borders on recklessness. Sometimes it works out, sometimes it doesn\u2019t, but we don\u2019t let that stop us from trying.\u201d\n\nWith the conditions we live under, we\u2019re often forced to make the impossible possible\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not that we\u2019re impulsive or stupid,\u201d \u00d6sp continued. \u201cWe just believe in our abilities to fix things. With the conditions we live under, we\u2019re often forced to make the impossible possible.\u201d\n\nAnd in many cases, Icelanders have made the impossible possible. They turned their stunning 2008 economic collapse and the disruptive 2010 eruptions of an unpronounceable volcano into PR opportunities that made Iceland one of the hottest destinations in the world, attracted millions of visitors and turned tourism into one of the main drivers of a now-robust economy. And in 2016, Iceland stunned the sporting world when it beat the odds to become the smallest country to ever qualify for the UEFA European Championship. Iceland beat England to make it to the quarter-finals against France. And though there was little chance they\u2019d win, roughly 8% of the Icelandic population travelled to Paris to cheer on the team (they ultimately lost 5-2).\n\nA 2017 University of Iceland survey showed that nearly half of Icelanders say \u2018\u00feetta reddast\u2019 is the philosophy they live by. Perhaps, as Sigmundsd\u00f3ttir and \u00d6sp suggest, this idea that everything will work out has been infused into Icelandic culture through the centuries. After all, for those who survived \u2013 and even thrived \u2013 against all odds, everything kind of did work out all right in the end.\n\n\u201cThis is just my home-grown theory,\u201d Sigmundsd\u00f3ttir said, \u201cbut I think the Icelanders had to face so many hardships that they learned to meet adversity with a combination of laissez-faire and capitulation. It\u2019s something that became ingrained in the Icelandic people through centuries of living with a climate and landscape that always had the upper hand, against which you had to surrender, again and again, because you couldn\u2019t fight them. It\u2019s difficult in Iceland not to feel your insignificance against the elements.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think this mentality shows that we have a belief in ourselves as a nation and as individuals,\u201d \u00d6sp added. \u201cWho would have believed, for example, that a team from a nation of 350,000 people could make it to the 2018 World Cup in Russia? We did \u2013 that\u2019s who.\u201d\n\nIt seems the Icelandic belief that things will turn out all right also comes with a little effort and ingenuity on the part of the believer.\n\nFor my husband and I, that meant trusting that everything would work out on our drive back to Reykjavik. If the \u2018\u00feetta reddast\u2019 attitude could help Icelanders thrive on a barely inhabitable rock on the edge of the North Atlantic, surely the same optimism could see us through a few hundred kilometres of remote mountain passes in the unreliable van.\n\nSo, just like those early settlers who set sail from Norway, we set out with little assurances but a lot of hope. Of course, we had one major advantage: we had mobile phones.\n\nJoin more than three million BBC Travel fans by liking us on Facebook, or follow us on Twitter and Instagram.\n\nIf you liked this story, sign up for the weekly bbc.com features newsletter called \"If You Only Read 6 Things This Week\".

Roman Jews have inhabited the Italian capital since the 2nd Century BC \u2013 well before the start of Christianity.\n\nA few minutes\u2019 walk from the imposing Piazza Venezia, close to the Tiber riverbank lies Via del Portico d\u2019Ottavia, the heart of the former Jewish Ghetto that was created by order of Pope Paul IV in 1555 and dismantled when Italian troops seized Rome from Papal rule in 1870.\n\nDuring springtime, when artichoke season begins, many of the tavernas that populate the narrow, cobbled streets of \u2018Il Ghetto\u2019 (as locals call it) try to lure in customers through the proud display of mammole, a local version of the globe artichoke which is mostly found in Rome\u2019s surrounding regions.\n\nYou may also be interested in:\n\n\u2022 Why is hummus controversial?\n\n\u2022 India\u2019s biryani wars\n\n\u2022 The pasta Sardinians refuse to share\n\nMammole are the core ingredient in the most iconic dish of Roma-Jewish cuisine, carciofi alla giudia, literally Jewish-style artichokes, a deep-fried artichoke with a tender heart and crispy golden crust that has been a local favourite since at least the 16th Century.\n\nNearly every diner orders the crispy carciofi during spring. \u201cIt would be extreme to say that a restaurant depends on a single dish,\u201d said Amit Dabush, owner of the popular kosher restaurant chain Ba\u2019Ghetto, which counts three venues in Rome and one in Milan. \u201cBut it\u2019s for sure the most demanded item on our menu.\u201d\n\nBut this spring, things did not run as smoothly for the restaurants of Via del Portico d\u2019Ottavia. A few weeks before the start of Passover \u2013 a festival that celebrates the Israelites\u2019 liberation from slavery in Egypt \u2013 in late March, Rabbi Yitzhak Arazi, head of imports of the Chief Rabbinate of Israel, declared that Jewish-style artichokes \u2013 a staple feature of the local Passover menu \u2013 should be considered trayf, or non-kosher.\n\nAs explained by Piero Stefani, professor of Jewish culture at the University of Ferrara, Jewish Kashrut, a system of rules about food, does not prohibit any vegetable \u2013 including artichokes. The problem, he said, is that artichokes may contain worms or other small insects, which are listed among forbidden foods in the Torah.\n\nAnd, indeed, that\u2019s what concerns Rabbi Arazi, who turned his attention to the matter after a canned version of Jewish-style artichokes started to become popular in Israel. \u201cThe heart of the artichoke is full of worms, and there is no way you can clean it,\u201d Arazi told Israeli newspaper Haaretz, explaining that the ban should not be considered as a local policy but as an application of Jewish religious law.\n\nRoman Jews did not take it well. Hundreds of people inundated social media with messages of solidarity for the hundreds-year-old dish, from angry posts to love poems and revisitations of popular mottos \u2013 the \u2018Je suis Charlie\u2019 meme that went viral after the attacks on French satirical magazine, Charlie Hebdo, in 2015 was turned into \u2018Je suis carciofo\u2019.\n\nThis is not a war about artichokes \u2013 It\u2019s about preserving the identity and traditions of local Jews\n\nMuch of the defence of Jewish-style artichokes is based on a physiological argument: local Roman artichokes have a different structure than other varieties, which makes them worm-proof. \u201cThe leaves of local artichokes are very compact,\u201d said Umberto Pavoncello, manager of one of the most popular kosher restaurants of Via Portico d\u2019Ottavia. \u201cThat makes them impenetrable to insects.\u201d Besides, no local rabbi has ever raised the issue, something that makes Pavoncello confident about the kosherness of local carciofi.\n\nSimone Somekh, a writer who published an artichoke defence in the online Jewish magazine Tablet says that the current worm dispute is part of a wider debate about bugs and vegetables. \u201cThere are kosher manuals that provide detailed instructions on how to best clean salad, broccoli or cauliflower to prevent insects,\u201d he said, \u201cbut sometimes the most orthodox fringes of the community prefer to ban a food item just to be safe.\u201d\n\nBut according to Somekh, Arazi\u2019s preventative ban does not take into account what Jewish-style artichokes mean for the local community. \u201cThis is not a war about artichokes,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s about preserving the identity and traditions of local Jews.\u201d\n\nA beloved dish Where to eat carciofi alla giudia in Rome: Nonna Betta: Named after the current owner\u2019s grandmother, Nonna Betta is one Il Ghetto\u2019s most popular establishments. Its Facebook page features many creative advertisements of carciofi alla giudia, including a photo of Hollywood actor Jake Gyllenhaal who allegedly dined at Nonna Betta in October 2017. Ba\u2019Ghetto Milky: Part of the kosher chain Ba\u2019Ghetto, this restaurant specialises in dairy and vegetable dishes (its sister venue, Ba\u2019Ghetto Meat, offers meat dishes). Owned by the Dabush family, who founded the dining chain in the 1980s after moving to Rome from Libya, Ba\u2019Ghetto Milky offers a mix of Arab and Jewish dishes that reflect the Dabush\u2019s family roots. La Taverna del Ghetto: Featuring paintings of traditional Jewish life and pictures of the old Ghetto, this venue is run by Italia Tagliacozzo, a long-standing connoisseur of Roman Jewish cuisine. After hearing about the artichoke ban, 80-year old Tagliacozzo told Italian daily newspaper Il Corriere della Sera that she has never found a worm in a local artichoke in her entire life.\n\nIndeed, the origins of carciofi alla giudia are deeply intertwined with the turbulent history of local Jews. When Pope Paul IV confined Jews inside the Ghetto, he issued a ban over the kind of professions they could practice. Food preparation was one of the few permitted activities, so many Jewish people, mostly women, started to run \u2018friggitorie\u2019, food stalls selling fritti (deep-fried foods). Even if friggitorie are not around anymore, their recipes can still be tasted in many kosher restaurants of Il Ghetto which feature them on their menus.\n\nUnlike other local fried foods that were often prepared with pork fat, Jewish fritti were cooked with olive oil both due to kosher rules (pork should not be eaten) and to the Mediterranean influences of Spanish and Sicilian Jews who flocked to the city after they were expelled from the Kingdom of Castile and Aragon in 1492.\n\nThis made foods cooked at friggitorie easily identifiable as \u2018Jewish\u2019, which is why the contentious artichoke dish is called \u2018Jewish-style\u2019 rather than just deep-fried. And indeed, getting the frying process right is key to making a good carciofo alla giudia.\n\n\u201cFirst you need to remove the harder external leaves and trim the stem with a paring knife,\u201d said Pavoncello, who learned the technique from the women of his family. The trimming, he explained, should be done from the base up in a spiral-like motion to give mammole their distinctive rosebud look. \u201cThen you dip it in medium-heat oil for about 15 minutes.\u201d The artichokes are then drained, dried and fried again, this time for no more than a couple of minutes, in higher heat oil that turns the outer leaves golden and crispy \u2013 a distinctive sign of a well-cooked carciofo.\n\nBut it was not just artichokes. Jewish friggitorie were able to turn other cheap but nutritious ingredients like courgettes, offal and codfish (the Ghetto was right by Rome\u2019s fish market at the time) into recipes that have become staple items of Roman cuisine, such as fiori di zucca fritti (stuffed courgette flowers), baccal\u00e0 fritto (fried codfish) and abbacchio fritto (fried lamb).\n\nConsidering that Jews were prevented from taking part in almost any cultural activity, from art to music to theatre, their gastronomic legacy is incredibly valuable. Much like the landscape of Il Ghetto, where Jewish monuments like the Great Synagogue stand side by side Renaissance gems such as the 16th-Century Turtle Fountain, Jewish and Roman food cultures have merged with one another, giving rise to a distinctive local food culture.\n\nBa\u2019Ghetto\u2019s owner, Dabush, said that since Rabbi Arazi\u2019s ban, he has stopped serving carciofi alla giudia in his Milan restaurant, but not in the ones in Rome. \u201cPeople complain about the lack of Jewish-style artichoke in Milan,\u201d he said, \u201cbut they eventually settled for it. In Rome, we would never dare take it off the menu.\u201d\n\nHe explained that a few years ago, another kosher dispute, this time about ciambellette (sweet doughnuts eaten during Passover) managed to reach a resolution. The problem in that case was that ciambellette are made using flour, which if not handled properly could leaven \u2013 something that is not permitted during Passover.\n\nBut the dish was not banned. Rome\u2019s rabbinate ruled that its preparation could still take place during Passover, albeit under the supervision of a mashgiach, a person instructed on Kashrut rules.\n\nDabush now hopes that something similar can happen with the beloved artichoke dish. \u201cCarciofi alla giudia have been standing as the ultimate symbol of Roman-Jewish cuisine for centuries,\u201d he said, adding that it would be unthinkable to run an artichoke-free menu in his venues. \u201cJewish culture does like compromises, but in this case, I really hope we can find a solution.\u201d\n\nFood Wars is a series from BBC Travel that invites you to feel the heat when passions flare around beloved dishes that shape a culture\u2019s identity.\n\nJoin more than three million BBC Travel fans by liking us on Facebook, or follow us on Twitter and Instagram.\n\nIf you liked this story, sign up for the weekly bbc.com features newsletter called \"If You Only Read 6 Things This Week\".

His stay was brief, but countless incursions by outsiders over the next two centuries would have a devastating impact on the Rapa Nui people.\n\nIn the 1860s, slavers from Peru brought around 1,000 islanders to the mainland. The few who made it back to the island brought smallpox with them, decimating the population. Many of those who survived the epidemic fled to Tahiti, leaving barely more than 100 Rapa Nui in 1888, when the island was annexed by Chile. Many of the Rongorongo tablets were lost or destroyed during this period, along with the only people who knew how to read them.\n\nThe language itself was vastly altered by the waves of foreign influence, with Tahitian, French, Spanish and English creeping into the lexicon.

It\u2019s a language that has mutated and metamorphosed because of everything that happened here.

People still were sleeping off the night before or finishing up late-day brunches to quell any lingering after-effects. Strains of jazz \u2013 an accordion, clarinet, tuba \u2013 leaked onto the street. Rainbow-bright clapboard houses competed with the brilliant blue of the sky.\n\nBut the most New Orleans detail of all was the paper cup I was holding. No, it wasn\u2019t a hurricane, that noxiously sweet rum cocktail every tourist sips through a straw at least once during their visit. It was the opposite: a remedy, affectionately dubbed \u2018Old Sober\u2019, said to right even the worst symptoms of fun.\n\nDespite how I\u2019d been served it, it wasn\u2019t a drink. It was a soup \u2013 sort of. More spaghetti than broth, this version was heady and potent, kicked up with a triple Sriracha-Crystal hot sauce-Tabasco threat, and laden with juicy, coin-sized chunks of alligator meat. Of the latter, New Orleans native Linda Green, better known as Ms Linda the Yakamein Lady, put it best: \u201cHe look like a mean character, but he's a beautiful piece of meat and a delicious piece of meat.\u201d\n\nYou may also be interested in:\n\n\u2022 The planet\u2019s most overrated sandwich?\n\n\u2022 The world\u2019s ultimate milkshake?\n\n\u2022 The burger McDonald\u2019s can\u2019t master\n\nYakamein (pronounced \u2018YAH-kah-main\u2019) is one of those foods that, if you weren\u2019t born and bred in New Orleans, you\u2019re sure you\u2019ve never heard of in your life. And then, with equal certainty, you suddenly know you can\u2019t live without it ever again. But live without it most of us must.\n\nYes, it sounds simple enough to make at home \u2013 especially as the most common version uses beef, a useful alternative if you, like me, don\u2019t have easy access to alligator (something that very much surprised Ms Linda when I told her). Boil leftover cuts of beef (extra authenticity points if they come from a Sunday roast cooked for family and friends). Simmer with salt, black pepper and garlic powder. Layer cooked spaghetti, tender bits of beef, chopped green onion and a boiled egg in a bowl or cup. Pour on the broth, give it a shake and let the flavours meld. Add extra hot sauce, if you want. Presto: yakamein.\n\nWhen you taste yakamein, you come back to life\n\nBut like any fiercely local dish, yakamein almost doesn\u2019t make sense outside of New Orleans. And not just because it\u2019s both answer and antidote to the city\u2019s fun-loving (and drink-swilling) attitude. It\u2019s also that its flavours are brewed from the Big Easy\u2019s multicultural web, and its cup-and-slurp style speaks to the city\u2019s warm, down-home lack of pretension.\n\nThe dish\u2019s legendary status even plays, in part, on the city\u2019s black magic beliefs \u2013 because \u2018Old Sober\u2019 is more than a cute name.\n\n\u201cSometimes, you know, you just out of it. But when you taste yakamein, believe it or not, you come back to life,\u201d said Ms Linda. \u201cMy daughter, she might go out with her girlfriends, and she\u2019ll come in in the morning \u2013 Maaaa, I need a yakamein. Maaaa, I need a yakamein. And I have to go get it.\u201d\n\nLike so much in New Orleans, yakamein is a hodgepodge and, because it\u2019s a hodgepodge, difficult to investigate. \u201cNobody can pinpoint exactly where it came from,\u201d said New Orleans native John Bel, one of a growing number of chefs to offer yakamein on the menu at his upscale restaurant Meauxbar.\n\nIt\u2019s thought to be a fusion that resulted when Chinese immigrants and African-Americans blended homes, kitchens and ingredients in the early 1900s. But others say it developed further after World War II, or maybe the Vietnam and Korean Wars, when soldiers returned from the Pacific Theatre with memories of hot noodle soups.\n\nYakamein almost doesn\u2019t make sense outside of New Orleans\n\nAdding to the confusion is that there are yakamein-like soups elsewhere. Pho has similarities. So does ramen. And you\u2019d be forgiven for thinking the closest variant, which hails from south-eastern Virginia, might even be the exact same thing. After all, it\u2019s called yock \u2013 short for yock-a-mein. But yock-a-mein comes in a Chinese take-out box. It uses lo-mein egg noodles, not spaghetti, and often features sausage and white onions, which yakamein does not. Instead of hot sauce, ketchup is key, vinegar optional. Chinese immigrants may have played a role in developing Virginia\u2019s version too, but the dish itself looks \u2013 and tastes \u2013 altogether different.\n\nAnd so, except for die-hard foodies or fans of Anthony Bourdain\u2019s No Reservations (which featured Ms Linda in 2011), yakamein is little known outside of New Orleans. When I mentioned to a couple of Baton Rouge residents that I was writing a story about yakamein, they had no idea what I was talking about.\n\n\u201cVery few visitors have heard of it. Some people, when they\u2019re a foodie or are in New Orleans to eat, they\u2019ve at least heard of it \u2013 but they don\u2019t quite understand what it is,\u201d Bel said.\n\nWhat everyone agrees on, though, is that no matter who began cooking yakamein or exactly when, it came from family kitchens and the streets. As well as being made at home, yakamein was sold outside jazz bars and on the sides of second lines, the parades of dancing, singing celebrants that got their start as funeral celebrations.\n\nThis, as well as New Orleans\u2019 general lack of pretension, also explains the local etiquette for eating yakamein: other than slurping it down in someone\u2019s kitchen, the most authentic way to enjoy it is in a to-go container. Spoons not only aren\u2019t required, they\u2019d be a hindrance.\n\nBel\u2019s version of yakamein, served up at Meauxbar, came from similarly down-home roots. One of the prep cooks used to bring yakamein to the restaurant for her lunch. Then she started sharing it with the staff. Then making it at staff meals. It didn\u2019t take long for the recipe to wind up on the menu, where now it\u2019s a daily favourite.\n\nMeauxbar\u2019s yakamein is good: layered with the umami of soy sauce, a heavy hand of celery and a dash of Worcestershire, it\u2019s made of more broth than others. (Partly for that reason, partly because of the upscale bistro surroundings, I used a spoon for this one \u2013 or tried to).\n\nBut later, when I think of New Orleans yakamein, it\u2019s Ms Linda\u2019s version I remember. I\u2019m not alone. Ms Linda is famed for dishing out thousands of cups of yakamein out of the back of her pick-up truck at second lines, the French Market, Jazz Fest and Mardi Gras. (Word to the wise: if you are going to ask Ms Linda how much yakamein she sells each Jazz Fest, don\u2019t do it while you have a mouth full of yakamein. \u201cOooh. Oh my God. There\u2019s a lot. It\u2019s a lot. It\u2019s over \u2013 25,000?\u201d Cue me spluttering soup. \u201cOh, don\u2019t choke!\u201d). Ms Linda cooks everything: etouffee and gumbo and jambalaya and beignets. But the recipe that she learned from her mamma, who learned it from her mamma, is yakamein.\n\nHer traditional recipe uses beef. But not only. \u201cI do alligator. I do crawfish. I do oysters. I do pork,\u201d she said. She\u2019s made sushi yakamein, jerk chicken yakamein and even yakamein-flavoured Bloody Marys. There\u2019s a vegetarian version, too.\n\nSpoons not only aren\u2019t required, they\u2019d be a hindrance\n\nMs Linda\u2019s complex and rich broth uses two special ingredients. The first might sound like a marketing clich\u00e9 except she believes in it so fervently, it\u2019s hard not to be persuaded: \u201cI put a lot of love into my cooking. A lot of it. Yes, I do.\u201d The second (which she\u2019s hinted is likely a mix of ingredients), inherited from her mother and grandmother\u2019s recipes, she\u2019s sworn even her family to secrecy about, complete with NDAs.\n\nWhatever her trick is, the result is obvious. \u201cIt\u2019s good,\u201d Ms Linda confirmed for me after I took my first slurp, a look of happy surprise on my face. \u201cSometimes I eat that yakamein and I say to myself, \u2018Oh Lawd, who made this!? This tastes so good, who made this!\u2019\u201d Who made it, of course, is Ms Linda.\n\nIn the middle of my conversation with Ms Linda at Bywater Bakery \u2013 the only place where you can find her yakamein regularly, outside of pop-ups \u2013 her phone rings. \u201cHey, baby,\u201d she said. \u201cOne yakamein? Okay. I\u2019m busy right now, honey. I\u2019m busy right now, but I be home in an hour. Get someone come to come pick it up, okay? Okay, baby.\u201d\n\n\u201cOne of your kids?\u201d I asked with a smile. \u201cOh, no,\u201d Ms Linda said. \u201cI don\u2019t know who that was.\u201d\n\nThis, it turns out, happens all the time. People get Ms Linda\u2019s number and call her when they need a yakamein fix. She used to drop it off for them. She doesn\u2019t do that anymore. Instead, she\u2019ll prepare it and leave it for her hungry customer to collect. And, she said, she won\u2019t ask for them to pay. \u201cOh, Amanda,\u201d she said. \u201cThis is my problem.\u201d\n\nMs Linda\u2019s phone rings with particular frequency on Sundays.\n\nIt turns out that this belief in yakamein\u2019s transformative effects is more than faith. In a conference talk a few years ago, food scientist Alyson E Mitchell said that, indeed, yakamein likely helps hangovers. Eggs have cysteine, an amino acid that helps scrub acetaldehyde (one of alcohol\u2019s toxic by-products) from the body. The fatty meat can help slow down the absorption of alcohol, making yakamein an equally good choice before a night out as it is after. The salty broth replaces the sodium lost during all those alcohol-induced trips to the toilet; it also encourages you to drink more water, fighting dehydration.\n\n\u201cIt may be a good example of intuitive science: an effective remedy, with the scientific basis revealed only years later,\u201d Mitchell said.\n\nLater, I wind my way down Bourbon Street. It isn\u2019t evening yet, but the street has that surreally unchanging sense of a party that never stops: 5pm or 5am, the lights are neon and the music is playing. Some African-American kids are enthralling a crowd, drumming an electric beat onto paint tins. A group of white 20-something women are striding down the street in tutus. An elderly couple stroll with walking sticks, Mardi Gras beads looped around their necks.\n\nThe night is young. Every option feels open. A jazz bar, or happy hour oysters? I\u2019m not sure, but I do know one thing: tomorrow, I\u2019m going to find myself some yakamein.\n\nJoin more than three million BBC Travel fans by liking us on Facebook, or follow us on Twitter and Instagram.\n\nIf you liked this story, sign up for the weekly bbc.com features newsletter called \"If You Only Read 6 Things This Week\".

Upon crossing the threshold, I was greeted with the echoes of a Gregorian chant that reverberated across the vaulted ceiling. Stretched before me was a long procession of archways leading to a single dais on the far side of the cathedral. A small set of steps climbed up to the altar, which was encased by a half dome immaculately adorned with sculptures and paintings depicting scenes of angels and the apostles.\n\nBut I hadn\u2019t come to Spain\u2019s third-largest city for the views of its cathedral. Instead, I made my way to a small room just off to the side, one so nondescript that I\u2019d nearly missed it on first glance. Within this humble chapel, encased in glass just beyond the altar, was the object I was searching for: a single cup, resting upon an illuminated golden pedestal. As legend has it, this is the very cup used by Jesus Christ during the Last Supper \u2013 or, as the cup is more commonly known, the Holy Grail.\n\nYou may also be interested in:\n\n\u2022 Was this the first Dead Sea Scroll?\n\n\u2022 A rare glimpse at Jesus\u2019 burial chamber\n\n\u2022 The world\u2019s first Christian country?\n\nAppearing in stories from the medieval epics of King Arthur and his knights to the silver-screen exploits of Indiana Jones, the Holy Grail has remained one of humanity\u2019s most sought-after treasures, a mysterious relic that straddles the line between fantasy and reality. Though the idea that a chalice used by Christ would be revered and therefore preserved by early worshippers is a plausible one, a magical vessel capable of granting eternal life is never mentioned in the Bible; it\u2019s convention of Arthurian legend, penned by the likes of Chr\u00e9tien de Troyes and Robert de Boron, two French poets who heavily shaped the development of Arthurian lore in the 12th and 13th Centuries. The first written mention of the grail as we\u2019ve come to know it is in de Troyes\u2019 Perceval, in which it is described not as a chalice but as a serving dish, likely harkening to the magical cauldrons of Celtic myth.\n\nGrowing up on the mythical tales of King Arthur, I\u2019ve always been a sceptic; for me, the grail is a literary treasure. Even so, I couldn\u2019t help but feel intrigued by Valencia\u2019s Santo C\u00e1liz (Holy Chalice). There are currently more than 200 claimants in Europe alone, all vying for the illustrious title of Holy Grail, with theories of the relic\u2019s final resting place found everywhere from Scotland to Accokeek, Maryland. Yet out of all the lists of claimants I researched, Valencia\u2019s chalice almost invariably held the top spot. It still manages to attract pilgrims from all over the world, and has even been used ceremonially by both Pope John Paul II and Pope Benedict XVI. Eager for the opportunity to follow in the footsteps of Sir Galahad on my own quest for the grail, I\u2019d come here to discover what makes this cup so special among so many others.\n\nI walked into La Capilla del Santo C\u00e1liz (Chapel of the Chalice) to find it empty. Although my timing was unintentional, I\u2019d arrived at the cathedral in the middle of a mass for Holy Saturday, the day before Easter Sunday, which meant that all the visitors were preoccupied with the ceremony in the adjacent room. A single beam of light streamed down from a stained-glass window far above the altar; the gentle hum of the distant choir was the only sound within the chapel. Though I had come to the place more as a researcher than a pilgrim, it was hard not to be taken by the quiet solemnity of the moment.\n\nAs I approached the altar to inspect the chalice more closely, I found it far more elaborate than I\u2019d anticipated. With two massive gold handles and a base inlaid with pearls, emeralds and rubies, the chalice immediately filled me with a sense of incredulity. Indeed, as anyone who has seen Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade is aware, the Holy Grail should be a simple thing \u2013 the cup of a carpenter.\n\nI was later informed by one of the attendants just outside the room that the actual relic is merely the piece at the top, a cup hewn from agate and polished with myrrh. The handles and base, which bear the hallmarks of medieval craftsmanship, weren\u2019t added until much later. My scepticism temporarily assuaged, I turned to the task of discovering how this cup supposedly made the journey from Jerusalem, where the Last Supper is believed to have taken place, to the east coast of Spain.\n\nAs with all stories of grail claimants, the tale is convoluted. An attendant of the cathedral was able to provide a basic explanation of how the chalice first made its way out of Jerusalem, some 2,000 years ago.\n\n\u201cSt Peter, the first pope, took the cup to Rome,\u201d she explained. \u201cThe popes were the only people who could give mass, so St Peter and the rest of popes used the grail for the Eucharist, considering it the one Christ used. Then, when the Emperor Valerian began to persecute the Christians [from 257 AD], it was sent to Huesca, Spain, because it was no longer safe in Rome.\u201d\n\nIt is a mysterious relic that straddles the line between fantasy and reality\n\nShe went on to explain that the chalice supposedly rested in Huesca for a few hundred years, before being moved again during the Umayyad conquests of the 8th Century, nestled in the cliff-side monastery of San Juan de la Pe\u00f1a in northern Spain for fear of plundering.\n\nGranted, accounts of these first thousand years of the grail\u2019s journeys are beyond anyone\u2019s ability to verify. The more reliable records of this chalice appear in 1399, when it became part King Martin of Aragon\u2019s royal reliquary. According to the cathedral\u2019s records, after Alfonso the Magnanimous took the throne in 1416, the reliquary was moved to Valencia and later given to the cathedral as a payment for a debt. Though the chalice was spirited away a few more times on the occasion of war, it inevitably returned to the Valencia Cathedral in 1939 \u2013 this time for good.\n\nThough an elaborate account, the story alone was not enough to make me believe this was the one true grail. After all, nearly all the grail claimants boast complex tales of how the relic was carried across seas and over mountains. Since none of the accounts can be verified, what has made so many believe that this is the one?\n\nThe main detail that sets the Valencia chalice apart is the style and craft of the agate cup, which Spanish archaeologist Antonio Beltr\u00e1n, who studied the chalice in 1960, claims indicates an origin somewhere between the 2nd Century BC to the 1st Century AD, likely from a workshop in the Middle East. The archaeological assessment suggests that this cup fits the bill, at least geographically and chronologically. Though far from definitive proof, the findings certainly bolster the chalice\u2019s claim.\n\nThe true wonder of the Holy Grail was never in the finding, but in the searching\n\nAs I stared at the agate cup resting in its glass case, there was one thought that continued to occupy my mind. If this was in fact the Holy Grail, one of the most legendary artefacts of all time, could it really be this easy? This was supposed to be the cup sought after time and time again by the heroes of old, only ever attained by those of purest heart \u2013 and yet here it was, not buried within the deep recesses of some distant cave but resting in a city centre surrounded by cafes filled with people casually sipping espressos.\n\nAs I made my way to leave, I asked one of the attendants her opinion. After all, weren\u2019t the stories of noble quests in pursuit of the Holy Grail not somewhat tarnished by the fact that it was here simply for all the world to see?\n\n\u201cI think the mystery remains,\u201d she said with a smile that made me feel it was not the first time she\u2019d heard the question, \u201cAfter all, this isn\u2019t even the only Holy Grail in Spain. You have to choose which is the real one for yourself.\u201d\n\nLater on, when doing some more research, I learned what she meant. In 2014, two historians published Kings of the Grail, a book in which they claim to have found the true grail in the Basilica of San Isidoro of Le\u00f3n in northern Spain. The pair cited two recently discovered ancient Egyptian manuscripts as the source of their discovery. Just as with Valencia\u2019s chalice, the new claimant had a detailed history behind it, and was also scientifically dated to the appropriate timeframe.\n\nThough the new discovery throws the Valencia chalice\u2019s claim into contention, I couldn\u2019t help but feel an odd sense of reassurance. For me, the true wonder of the Holy Grail was never in the finding, but in the searching. The treasure isn\u2019t the cup, but the stories we have crafted around it throughout time. I felt content knowing that so long as new contenders continue to appear, the mystery will endure, the legend will survive and the quest for the Holy Grail will go on.\n\nJoin more than three million BBC Travel fans by liking us on Facebook, or follow us on Twitter and Instagram.\n\nIf you liked this story, sign up for the weekly bbc.com features newsletter called \"If You Only Read 6 Things This Week\".

I once had an entire conversation with a waiter in which he asked me where I was from, what language I spoke, where exactly England was, and finally ended with the question he was really trying to ask: do you eat spicy food?\n\nHaving experienced so much curiosity around the level of heat that I can handle, I was well prepared when a friend asked me if I like chilli while a group of us were out for drinks in Oaxaca city. I waxed lyrical about my love of chillies, the great variety found in Mexico, the level of spice of each chilli and just how much I could handle. What began as stifled giggles among the group became full-on belly laughs, with some of the group almost crying with laughter.\n\nAlbur would have me both intrigued and confused for years to come\n\nI giggled along nervously, like a child who doesn\u2019t understand a joke, while I rapidly ran through what I had said, looking for possible mistakes in my Spanish that could have caused such amusement. Suppressing giggles, one of my friends said, \u201cso you really like Mexican chilli, then?\u201d and the whole table fell about laughing again. At that moment, it clicked: \u2018chilli\u2019 must have a double meaning, and it didn\u2019t take long to work out what that double meaning was. My cheeks went puce as I ran back over what I had been saying through their filter, my blushing face making everyone laugh even more.\n\nThis was my introduction to albur, a Mexican play on words that would have me both intrigued and confused for years to come.\n\nYou may also be interested in:\n\n\u2022 The confusing way Mexicans tell time\n\n\u2022 The slang that transformed Spanish\n\n\u2022 The city where people don\u2019t get angry\n\nMost albures have to do with sex. \u201c[It\u2019s a] way of talking about sex without talking about it,\u201d said Dr Lucille Herrasti, professor of linguistics at the Autonomous University of Morelos. Like in many societies, many Mexicans view sex as a taboo subject. \u201cUsing albur is a way to generate the meaning behind the words without using the actual words,\u201d Herrasti added, noting that albures have to be funny in order to make the ordinarily prohibited subject more approachable. She explained how objects that have phallic characteristics \u2013 such as the chilli \u2013 are used to craft double entendres. The result is that one can be innocently talking about making salsa from chilli, and someone else will hear something more salacious.\n\nIt\u2019s a way of talking about sex without talking about it\n\nGrowing up in England, I am no stranger to the double entendre. The UK is rather fond of double meanings, and I learnt at a young age that often what people say isn\u2019t what they really mean. I spent my youth watching shows ripe with covert sexual references, like Are You Being Served, Blackadder and \u2018Allo \u2018Allo!, and listening to the incredible linguistic wordplays on the BBC Radio 4 show, I\u2019m Sorry I Haven\u2019t A Clue. Even Shakespeare gave us multiple double entendres in his work. The title of his play, Much Ado About Nothing, is a cheeky play on words where \u2018no-thing\u2019 was a reference to female genitalia.\n\nHerrasti explained that, in Mexico, albures can take multiple forms. There is the use of hidden meanings in words, as well as the rearranging of words and phrases to create new meanings. Some more tame albures also come from using words with similar sounds to create alternatives to traditional expressions, in much the same way that Brits might say \u2018oh sugar\u2019 rather than using a more charged swear word. While some see albur as childish or in bad taste, for Herrasti it is an art form, where the quick-witted speaker has \u201ca really good ability with language\u201d.\n\nI love playing with words \u2013 I am a writer, after all, and a love of words comes with the job. Learning Spanish opened my world up to a whole new language with which to toy. However, wordplay in a second language is a greater challenge than wordplay in your mother tongue, and despite having a solid grasp of Mexican Spanish, albur can still leave me for dust.\n\nI am not alone, apparently. Gregorio Desgarennes, who teaches Mexican slang to non-native speakers in his home city of Oaxaca, says that foreigners not only have to translate the words but then look for the hidden meaning behind them, which makes understanding albures \u2013 often passed back and forth between friends in rapid fire \u2013 extremely difficult. Beyond that, he explains that the hidden meanings can be so well veiled that they are hard for even Mexicans to understand.\n\nThe origins of albur are as hard to pin down as the quick tongues of its users. Herrasti explained that academics who have been investigating the origins of albur believe it to have come from the mines of central Mexico, where groups of miners used it as a way to entertain each other. Yet most Mexicans whom I have spoken to claim that its roots go much further back to the Spanish conquest, with the indigenous population finding a way to play with the Spanish using the language imposed on them.\n\nDesgarennes explains that as he sees it, albur represents resistance \u201cto speaking \u2018well\u2019\u201d and a transgression from the norm. He describes albur as short form among the working class that tells the other person, \u201cwe both come from the barrio [a lower-class neighbourhood]\u201d and automatically creates a sense of trust. The more complicated and complex the albures get, the more trust is built.\n\nAlbur is such a recognised part of Mexican culture that there is now a competition every year to find Mexico\u2019s best albureros, or wordplay masters. Each contestant comes to the table with an original albur to which their opponent must respond within five seconds with another albur. This back and forth continues until one person is unable to retaliate and is knocked out of the competition. Almost like a display of masculinity, the albur competition was long dominated by men until 20 years ago when Lourdes Ruiz, a female market vendor from Tepito, a working-class neighbourhood of Mexico City, was crowned the \u2018Queen of Albur\u2019, a title that no-one has been able to strip her of since.\n\nThe Queen of Albur is now leading the way in the world of wordplay, and Mexico City residents can enrol in a diploma in albur fino, or \u2018refined albur\u2019, taught by Ruiz herself. Offered free of charge, the course attracts participants from across the socioeconomic spectrum who want to learn from the best. For Alfonso Hern\u00e1ndez and Rusbel Navarro, who run the course alongside Ruiz, albur should be seen as far more than just funny sexual euphemisms. For them, it is a kind of \u201cmental chess\u201d that involves a linguistic mastery.\n\nAlbur transforms everyday words into another transgressive language experience\n\nAn important form of cultural identity among Mexico\u2019s often marginalised working class, albur, Hern\u00e1ndez and Navarro explain, is also a way of using humour to laugh in the face of power \u2013 and more importantly \u2013 horror. \u201cAlbur transforms everyday words into another transgressive language experience. Therefore, with albur, those who survive tragedies can live [with] them with humour.\u201d It is much like the old saying, \u201cif you don\u2019t laugh you will cry.\u201d\n\nThis explanation makes a lot of sense in a country as complex as Mexico. Mexicans see tragedy in the news daily, and yet laughter and playfulness are everywhere you go. Film director Guillermo del Toro spoke further to this point when asked how he was able to reconcile his dark films with his always-happy personality. His response was simple: \u201cI am Mexican.\u201d\n\nOpinions about albur seem to be divided in the country: some consider albur linguistic poetry, while others feel it is juvenile and derogatory. Between 2014 and 2016, it was widely reported in Mexico that Unesco had declared albur to be of intangible cultural heritage, which, while apparently untrue, sparked a debate among Mexicans about this form of speech. According to a study conducted by the Strategic Communications Cabinet, only 21% of the population felt that albur was a form of Mexican ingenuity.\n\nIngenious or not, for us foreigners, it will likely continue to be a source of confusion. Despite my training, from Shakespeare to Blackadder, I am resigned to the fact that for as long as I live in Mexico I may never truly be safe when talking about how well I can handle my chilli.\n\nJoin more than three million BBC Travel fans by liking us on Facebook, or follow us on Twitter and Instagram.\n\nIf you liked this story, sign up for the weekly bbc.com features newsletter called \"If You Only Read 6 Things This Week\".

It lies 68km south-west of Strasbourg in France, 93km north-west of Basel in Switzerland and 74km north-west of Freiburg in Germany. Today, due to modern maps and precise methods of measuring longitude and latitude, we can pinpoint exactly where it is on the planet. However, a few hundred years ago, when much of the world was mysterious and unknown, a group of European humanists came together here to produce an extraordinary map of the world \u2013 one that differed radically from what came before, and whose effects are still with us today. This town is responsible for giving the entire continent of America its name.\n\nThis town is responsible for giving the entire continent of America its name\n\nThe map, printed in 1507, measured about 1.4m by 2.4m, a size that matched its grand ambition to portray the world in its entirety. And indeed, it did depict more of the world than ever before. For centuries, Europeans had believed that the world was made up of three landmasses: Asia, Africa and Europe, with Jerusalem at its centre. That\u2019s why Italian explorer and coloniser for Spain, Christopher Columbus, had gone to his deathbed just a year earlier believing that where he had landed in the Americas was just another part of Asia. However, this new map depicted a fourth part of the world for the first time. To the left of Europe, it showed a long, thin version of South America, with a small-sized North America above it. The new continent was surrounded by water, and, on the part that is known today as Brazil, the map-makers placed a name: America.\n\nYou may also be interested in:\n\n\u2022 The town that split the world in two\n\n\u2022 The tiny island traded for Manhattan\n\n\u2022 The Silicon Valley of the Middle Ages\n\nThis milestone in cartography is known as the Waldseem\u00fcller map, after the German humanist who drew it. But Martin Waldseem\u00fcller was just one of a group of scholars who Walter Lud, the canon of the church of St-Di\u00e9-des-Vosges, brought together in this town. Lud was particularly interested in cosmography \u2013 the study of the Earth and its place in the universe \u2013 and wanted to create a picture of the world that combined ancient knowledge with the new reports coming in from the voyages that were taking place at the time. To this end, he secured funding from Ren\u00e9 II, Duke of Lorraine, to set up a printing press called Gymnasium Vosagense and assembled a team that included Waldseem\u00fcller and another German humanist, Matthias Ringmann. According to Toby Lester, author of The Fourth Part of the World: The Race to the Ends of the Earth, and the Epic Story of the Map that Gave America its Name, Ringmann took the lead in writing the book that was printed along with the map and almost certainly coined the name America.\n\nThat these two Germans came together to undertake such as project in St-Di\u00e9-des-Vosges was not simply a question of money. The location of the town was also significant. As Toby Lester told me, \u201cYou had explorers setting off from the Atlantic coast in Spain and Portugal, who were bringing all their information back there, and the Italians who were funding and going on these expeditions, churning through a lot of the information, and the Germans in the middle, doing strong, leading work with printing.\u201d St-Die, near Strasbourg, Basel and Freiburg, was, like other locations that set up printing presses, at a convergence where information could move back and forth easily.\n\nToday, only a few clues point to the medieval history of St-Di\u00e9-des-Vosges, which was mostly rebuilt after World War II. An outline of the continent of America is paved on the ground just outside the cathedral in a matching pink sandstone that you might mistake for a decorative pattern; a stone gargoyle of an indigenous person from the continent can be spotted in its cloister; and each year the town hosts an international festival of geography where geography experts and enthusiasts get together to exchange ideas. Perhaps this is why most visitors to the town don\u2019t know about its map-making history, or that they can see a remnant of it by simply making an appointment the bright and modern local library.\n\nI was one of the few visitors to St-Di\u00e9-des-Vosges to make the trip down the stairs of the library, past the colourful children\u2019s paintings decorating the walls to the Salle du Tr\u00e9sor, or Treasure Room. Last year, only 664 people came here, compared to the 18,000 who visited the Tourist Office. It is a small, narrow room with wooden display cases that contrasts with the rest of the library\u2019s contemporary feel. Here, among the other old and rare books on display, such as the beautifully illustrated song book Graduel, is an original version of the book that was printed along with the Waldseem\u00fcller map in 1507: the Cosmographiae Introductio, or Introduction to Cosmography.\n\nThese words were the cause of contention for centuries to come\n\nThe tome, written entirely in Latin, clearly states its purpose: as an \u201cintroduction to the world that we have depicted on a globe and on a flat surface\u201d. The \u2018flat surface\u2019 refers to the Waldseem\u00fcller map, which was printed on 12 separate sheets of paper to be pieced together on a flat surface, while the \u2018globe\u2019 refers to a smaller version of the map that was designed to be cut out and pasted onto a ball \u2013 making it history\u2019s first ever commercially printed globe and demonstrating, contrary to popular belief, that medieval Europeans knew perfectly well that the world was spherical rather than flat. Significantly, the text also explains the reason behind the naming of the continent, which it claims was discovered by the Italian explorer Amerigo Vespucci. Since other continent names were feminine in Latin \u2013 Europa, Africa, Asia \u2013 the author reasoned that the name of this new land should also be feminised, into \u201cAmerica, after its discoverer\u201d.\n\nThese words were the cause of contention for centuries to come. From the Spanish friar Bartolom\u00e9 de la Casas, who in first half of the 16th Century said that it was an \u201cinjury and injustice\u201d to Columbus, whose voyages to the Americas predated Vespucci\u2019s, to American writer Washington Irving, who in 1809 wrote of the \u201ccrafty wiles\u201d by which the Florentines stole the glory of Columbus. But although Columbus\u2019 four voyages across the Atlantic Ocean started in 1492, when he encountered the islands of the Caribbean, he only touched continental soil on his third journey in 1498. Contrarily, according to a letter dated 1504 from Vespucci to Duke Ren\u00e8 that was reprinted in Introduction to Cosmography and describes his four voyages from 1497 to 1504, he reached the mainland a year earlier than Columbus. Historians have called the authenticity of this letter into doubt, but Waldseem\u00fcller and Ringmann took Vespucci\u2019s letter at face value, basing their naming of the new continent on its contents.\n\nThe name of the new continent was not the only debate surrounding the map. Much was made of the fact that the new continent was shown to be surrounded by water. How did the map-makers in St-Di\u00e9-des-Vosges know, in 1507, that there was water on the other side of the land that Columbus and Vespucci had come across? According to records, the first European to set eyes on the Pacific Ocean was Spanish explorer Vasco N\u00fa\u00f1ez de Balboa, who saw it from a mountain top in Panama six years later, in 1513. Was it guesswork, or did the map-makers have access to information from alleged Portuguese voyages to the other side of the continent, kept secret because they crossed over into Spanish waters? (In 1494, the Spanish and the Portuguese decided to divide the entire world west of Europe between them in the Treaty of Tordesillas. Everything beyond what is today known as Brazil was Spanish territory, which is why Brazil is the only Portuguese-speaking country in South America.)\n\nAnother mystery concerned the very existence of the map. Although 1,000 copies of the Waldseem\u00fcller map were printed in 1507, they all soon disappeared. Unlike the book, which was preserved in libraries, the maps were displayed in educational institutions and didn't last as long. Map enthusiasts spent centuries searching for and trying to reconstruct the Waldseem\u00fcller map based on the descriptions in the Introduction to Cosmography. Eventually, one remaining map was discovered in 1901 by Father Joseph Fischer, a professor in history and geography, in Wolfegg Castle, Germany. It was this map, sometimes referred to as \u2018the birth certificate of America\u2019 that was bought by the US Library of Congress in 2003 for an astounding $10 million.\n\nHowever, the value of the Waldseem\u00fcller map is not simply its depiction and naming of America. As Lester explained, \u201cThe map is like a Wikipedia entry, combining and editing a lot of different people\u2019s information. Yes, it is a geographical map, but it is not just about space, it is about time.\u201d\n\nIt is not just about space, it is about time\n\nThis idea is represented by the two images at the top of the map: one of the Greek geographer Ptolemy, who represents the old way of looking at the world and an entire ancient body of knowledge; and the other of Vespucci, who represents a new way of looking at the world, fuelled by modern learning and discovery. The juxtaposition of these two different ages can be seen in the cartography itself; for example, the way Europe is depicted is not technically accurate \u2014 not because Waldsee\u00fcller did not have a more refined idea of the geography of Europe, but because, as Lester writes, he decided \u201che would depict the known world exactly as Ptolemy has mapped it more than 1,000 years earlier.\u201d\n\nAdditionally, showing two men at the top of the map instead of God, as was common, also conveyed a powerful message: \u201cPreviously it was only God who could look down upon the world, but now we can show you everything at once. And that leads to this idea of empire, because if we can map and own the whole world, we can preside over the whole world.\u201d Lester said.\n\nUltimately, the Waldseem\u00fcller map reminds us that all maps are political. By putting north at the top of the map, whereas the previous convention was to place east at the top, and placing Europe at the middle, makes it literally Eurocentric. The decision of the map-makers to name an entire, inhabited continent after a European man who went there, privileges the European perspective and demonstrates the European attitude and ambition of the time. It is an outlook that predicts the way in which the Europeans would continue to take possession of lands, resources and people, erasing cultures and killing millions.\n\nAs Lester summarises in his book, \u201cIt\u2019s a birth certificate for the world that came into being in 1492 \u2013 and it\u2019s a death warrant for the one that was there before.\u201d\n\nPlaces That Changed the World is a BBC Travel series looking into how a destination has made a significant impact on the entire planet.\n\nJoin more than three million BBC Travel fans by liking us on Facebook, or follow us on Twitter and Instagram.\n\nIf you liked this story, sign up for the weekly bbc.com features newsletter called \"If You Only Read 6 Things This Week\".

I was cycling from the German border to Copenhagen across Denmark's islands \u2013 but had been side-tracked by the curious story of southern Jutland's rebel cakes.\n\nDybb\u00f8l Windmill had ground wheat into flour across the centuries from 1774, despite being pummelled in two Schleswig wars and destroyed more than once by fire. After the Prussian-Austrian occupation of southern Jutland in 1864, the mill was, if anything, busier than ever. When the occupiers refused to give the Danes an alcohol license for their community halls, the defiant Jutlanders thought that if they couldn\u2019t have their beloved coffee punch with schnapps, they\u2019d have cake instead \u2013 made with flour from the mill, of course.\n\nYou may also be interested in:\n\n\u2022 The cakes beloved by anarchists\n\n\u2022 The unlikely sausage that saved lives\n\n\u2022 A secret island obsessed with food\n\nThe community hall was an important part of Danish culture; a place to meet and share ideas. During the occupation, the need for the Jutland Danes to preserve their national identity became even more important. The hall became a Danish micro-society, a safe haven, where the southern Jutlanders could sing patriotic Danish songs and celebrate their Danish-ness. The kaffebord, or coffee table, was not so much about coffee (now that the Danes couldn't make coffee punch) but about the Danish cakes that stretched along the long table.\n\nWith every year that passed under the occupation, the spreads became more elaborate, as Jutland's cake-making housewives jostled to be queen of the kaffebord. Cream cakes, pastries, fruit tarts and biscuits of every sort crammed the table. It was full-on competition, but more importantly, it was an act of defiance and resistance against the oppressor. After a referendum in 1920, southern Jutland was handed back to the Danes, and although the liquor license was granted again, the coffee table, too good to abandon, continued to thrive. To this day, it's a favourite way to celebrate birthdays, anniversaries and other special events in the region.\n\nIt was an act of defiance and resistance against the oppressor\n\nDybb\u00f8l Windmill didn't just produce flour for the coffee-table cakes, however; the patriotic miller allowed Danish soldiers to use it as an observation post during the second Schleswig war of 1864. Signals were transmitted to the men on the watch, but despite the army's best efforts, they were unable to hold their line of defence at Dybb\u00f8l against the better equipped Prussian-Austrian army. The Danish were overwhelmed and south Jutland was captured.\n\nThe visitor centre attached to the windmill tells this story, while across the road, on the site of the Dybb\u00f8l Battlefield, a memorial pays homage to the fallen Danish soldiers. Below it, the land drops away to the Strait of Alssund and the fishing town of S\u00f8nderborg just out of sight, where I was heading in search of the Jutland coffee table and its mountain of cake.\n\nI swung my leg over my bicycle and free-wheeled through fields of bright rapeseed down to the strait. Across the water, the red roofs and colourful facades of the harbour houses stretched out along the quayside to a heavily fortified castle. Now a museum, S\u00f8nderborg Castle tells the story of Prussian-Austrian occupation of southern Jutland after the 1864 Schleswig War, and again of German occupation in World War II. I wanted to find out more.\n\nIgnoring the attractive waterfront with its terraced cafes and castle for the moment, I crossed the drawbridge and pushed on up the hill to a pedestrianised shopping street in the heart of the town. The restaurant, Det S\u00f8nderjyske K\u00f8kken (The South Jutland Cuisine), was hosting a coffee-table event \u2013 and I was about to eat my own weight in cake and biscuits, or so it seemed. Inside, the room was filled with locals and a handful of Dutch and Germans, along with my holidaying British companions. At the head of the room, a long table was stacked high with meringues, puddings, cakes, pastries and biscuits. Working along the table from left to right, I piled my plate high, glad that most of the portions were small or bite-sized.\n\n\u201cThe number of cakes on the table has varied through the years,\u201d Jesper, the restaurant owner explained to me. \u201cBut somehow we seem to have settled on seven. Nowadays, tradition decrees there should be seven soft cakes and seven hard cakes \u2013 and sometimes, when there's a really extravagant kaffebord, there will be seven layered cream cakes as well.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo, where do I start?\u201d I asked.\n\n\u201cWe start with pomle \u2013 the bread roll with butter,\u201d he answered.\n\nI ate the cardamom-flavoured roll with jam before going on to try the S\u00f8nderjysk festkringle, a buttery Danish pastry made with candied citrus peel and raisins.\n\n\u201cNow we eat the two \u2018stop cakes\u2019,\u201d said Jesper. \u201c\u2018Stop\u2019 meaning have a rest with the lighter cakes before returning to the richer soft cakes. Honningkage is honeyed gingerbread topped with apricot compote \u2013 and krydderkage is a plain spicy cake.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt must have been very expensive to lay on so many elaborate cakes during the Prussian occupation, was it not?\u201d I asked.\n\n\u201cThat's true. The most elaborate coffee tables were held in rural areas where country folks had the ingredients on their farms,\u201d he said.\n\nReturning to the richer soft cakes, I tried the rabarber trifli, a delicious rhubarb trifle, then the blommet\u00e6rte, a plum tart, before finishing with the br\u00f8'tort, a nutty rye cake with a blackcurrant topping. There was no question; I was on a sugar rush.\n\nBut just as partakers think they have reached a saturation point with these rich and filling \u2018soft cakes\u2019, the thoughtful Jutland cake-makers calm the palate \u2013 and the stomach \u2013 with seven plainer and lighter \u2018hard cakes\u2019, or biscuits.\n\nFirst up was the knepkager, its delightful name describing the crunch the biscuit makes when you bite into it, then the fedtkager, a biscuit made with lard. Next, I tried the almond n\u00f8ddetvebakker, baked twice (once to harden the biscuit, and again to give it its warm brown colour). After that came the herrnhutkager, a syrupy, spicy bake with orange and lemon zest, cloves and pepper.\n\nMy cake marathon had almost come to an end: I feasted on vaniljekrans (a vanilla ring cake) and the wonderfully named goder\u00e5d, which translates as \u2018good advice\u2019. Last of all, I bit into the ingenting, a meringue drizzled with rum. The meringue name demonstrates the Danes mischievous sense of fun: when guests had munched their way through six hard cakes, they would be asked what they could still eat. \u2018Nothing,\u2019 they would usually reply, and would promptly be offered ingenting, which means \u2018nothing\u2019.\n\nA huge variety of cakes and biscuits can be found at coffee tables across southern Jutland, some with strange and amusing names: s\u00f8sterkage (sister cake), and kys og klap (kisses and applause), for example. But the most intriguing of all are the fried biscuits called klejner, or \u2018twisted boys and girls\u2019. The boys are cut into rectangular shapes, with one end of the pastry pulled through the hole in the middle to make clear the boy's gender, while the girls are cut with a round glass and twisted into a feminine shape, with a hole made with a thimble.\n\nI staggered out of Det S\u00f8nderjyske K\u00f8kken, my stomach filled with spice and sugar and fruit and nuts. I thought about the Danish gathered in their community halls, defiantly holding meetings, singing patriotic Danish songs and eating cake in spite of their Prussian oppressors, only to experience German occupation all over again in World War II. \u201cWhat must that have been like?\u201d I wondered.\n\nI spent the night in a country cottage overlooking the Baltic Sea just a few miles through the woods on the other side of the harbour. Outside, the wind rustled in the great copper beech, a red tree once planted next to many dwellings across southern Jutland to mark the home of Danish patriots, who also painted their doors red to demonstrate their alliance to the Danish flag.\n\nIn the morning, I had a visit from the 78-year-old former mayor of S\u00f8nderborg, Mr Hansen. Nobody seems to know his Christian name, and he is simply referred to as AP. He had come by to tell me about life under the second German occupation. Born at the beginning of World War II, his early childhood was marred by war and the new German occupation. We sat down under the window, surrounded by sofa throws and candles, the blue of the Baltic Sea sparkling in the sunlight beyond the barley field. It was hard to imagine those turbulent times in this peaceful place.\n\n\u201cHow did the Jutland Danes feel about being occupied all over again in the Second World War?\u201d I asked.\n\n\u201cYou know, it was very peaceful to begin with,\u201d he said. \u201cThe Germans didn't try to suppress our Danish culture. We were allowed to get on with our lives as usual, so there was little resistance initially. The resistance came later in 1943 when Hitler called for the deportation of Danish Jews. When the Danish Resistance organised a strike, the German occupiers became more heavy-handed. Nonetheless, even in the early days, it was still a shock to be occupied all over again. The Germans arrived in the springtime. The air was different and there was the constant drone of planes. Whenever I hear the sound of planes in spring, it\u2019s still emotional for me.\u201d\n\nIt was a shock to be occupied all over again\n\nMr Hansen ran his fingers over a stock of white hair, lost in memories of the war. \u201cMy parents were good people,\u201d he said. \u201cThey took in a Jewish boy, Hans Franz, and eventually helped him to get to Sweden. Later, my mother sheltered a Danish woman who'd had a child to a German soldier. My parents weren\u2019t the only decent Danes: many other ordinary Danes helped to evacuate more than 7,000 Jews to Sweden.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd how do people feel about the Germans now after two occupations?\u201d I asked.\n\n\u201cThere is still a German minority group living here, and they are encouraged to preserve their own culture,\u201d he replied. \u201cThey have their own schools, libraries and sports clubs. We have a good relationship with our German neighbours too. There are many German tourists who come back faithfully year after year to spend their holidays here. They love Denmark and its culture.\u201d\n\nI thought of the German visitors who had mingled with the Danes at the kaffebord at Det S\u00f8nderjyske K\u00f8kken the day before. The coffee table, once associated with war and rebellion, had become an opportunity for shared friendship and cake.\n\nIt's always been a very personal experience\n\nWhen chatting to Gerda Bouma from the local tourism office, she mused: \u201cYou know, the coffee table has been southern Jutland's best-kept secret. It's always been a very personal experience for the local people who have held it in their own homes on special occasions with close family and friends over the decades. But it's time to share the coffee table experience with others, don't you think?\"\n\nI couldn't have agreed more as I cycled away from S\u00f8nderborg with a belly full of cake.\n\nJoin more than three million BBC Travel fans by liking us on Facebook, or follow us on Twitter and Instagram.\n\nIf you liked this story, sign up for the weekly bbc.com features newsletter called \"If You Only Read 6 Things This Week\".

Mixing everything in a peanut sauce, she handed the salad, called lotek, to customers who puttered up on motorbikes and waited on blue plastic stools. She was curious about me, full of questions, and the feeling was mutual. It was to chat with people like her that I had moved to Indonesia and enrolled in intensive language study. Yet after hundreds of hours of classes, I couldn\u2019t understand what she was saying.\n\nEverything she said sounded to me like it had half a syllable. I did make out familiar words, but painfully rarely. I wondered what her life was like in this city, how she felt about escalating political and cultural tension in this young democracy and the world\u2019s most populous Muslim-majority nation. But I wasn\u2019t to find out.\n\nShe handed me my meal wrapped in newspaper, the text of which I could understand. \u2018Bahasa Indonesia baku\u2019, I thought to myself \u2013 textbook Bahasa Indonesia. My teachers had referred to the language as \u2018baku\u2019, or \u2018standard\u2019, in class, emphasising that it was this version of Indonesian, the nation\u2019s official language, we were learning. The addendum hadn\u2019t struck me as overly important, but it should have.\n\nYou may also be interested in:\n\n\u2022 The Asian language designed to unify\n\n\u2022 The pidgin language uniting 83 islands\n\n\u2022 The island that forever changed science\n\nBahasa Indonesia\u2019s antecedent, Malay, evolved and spread during the last millennium because of the need in maritime South-East Asia \u2013 where hundreds of languages are still spoken across the thousands of islands that now comprise the modern nations of Indonesia, Malaysia and Singapore \u2013 for a lingua franca for trade and other exchanges. Malay was seen to be grammatically simple, non-hierarchical and easier to learn than other regional languages. It was the mother tongue of few, but as people travelled around the region, it became their accepted means to communicate.\n\nThen, in the early 20th Century, Indonesian nationalists, plotting independence from Dutch colonial rule, agreed that a reformed version of Malay, with an expanded vocabulary and a new name \u2013 Bahasa Indonesia \u2013 should become the official language of the soon-to-be independent nation. Malay, according to Cornell University Indonesian scholar Benedict Anderson, was \u201csimple and flexible enough to be rapidly developed into a modern political language\u201d.\n\nThe goal for Bahasa Indonesia was to break down communication barriers and facilitate inclusion of more than 300 ethnic groups in the new nation, whose independence was officially recognised in 1949. Because no major ethnic group, including the Javanese (whose highly complex language was at the time spoken by about 40% of the population), would have its mother tongue as the official language, inequality would not be created or reinforced. Bahasa Indonesia would help draw unity out of diversity.\n\nBut in reality, things aren\u2019t so simple. Today, standard Bahasa Indonesia, which hasn\u2019t evolved too drastically from Malay, is rarely spoken in casual conversations. People think it\u2019s too \u2018kaku\u2019, meaning rigid and stiff, my language teacher Andini told me after I admitted my difficulties at the roadside stall. Moreover, people sometimes find Bahasa Indonesia inadequate to express what they want. Andini confessed she often shares this frustration, wanting to use words and expressions from a sub-dialect of East Javanese spoken in her hometown.\n\nPeople sometimes find Bahasa Indonesia inadequate to express what they want\n\nPart of the problem lies in the language itself: Bahasa Indonesia has fewer words than most languages. Endy Bayuni of The Jakarta Post has written that foreign translations of Indonesian novels tend to read better, while Indonesian translations of foreign novels sound \u2018verbose and repetitive\u2019. But there\u2019s also a political dimension. Because Indonesians learn Bahasa Indonesia in school, then hear it as adults primarily in political speech, they associate it with homogeneity, according to Dr Nancy J Smith-Hefner, associate professor of anthropology at Boston University. This is exacerbated because Bahasa Indonesia was heavily promoted during the Suharto dictatorship that ruled from the mid-1960s until 1998 and stifled many forms of individual and cultural expression. Because of this, those who speak it risk looking \u201ctheatrical, bookish or pompous\u201d, explained Nelly Martin-Anatias of the Institute of Culture, Discourse and Communication at the Auckland University of Technology.\n\nIt turns out that a means to linguistically unite the Indonesian nation has instead, due to the language\u2019s simplicity and rigidity, created a new barrier that prevents communication on a deeper level \u2013 one that Indonesians circumvent by employing their own particularised speech, tailored to their specific regions, generations or social classes.\n\nPeople dissatisfied with Bahasa Indonesia have plenty of options. There are hundreds of regional languages and dialects, sometimes spoken intact, sometimes blended with Bahasa Indonesia. In Yogyakarta, where I am \u2013 located in the centre of Java and the traditional heartland of Javanese culture \u2013 Javanese is commonly spoken, partly as a reflection of cultural pride. A food vendor who pushes his wooden cart along my street every morning selling soto ayam (spicy chicken soup) often breaks into Javanese, making our conversations difficult for me to follow. He recently asked me something three times before I understood. The question, when I got it, revealed a pride in his heritage: had I yet seen wayang kulit (shadow puppet play), the quintessentially Javanese cultural performance?\n\nMeanwhile, Indonesia\u2019s youth continue to form their own, cooler language variants, gleefully challenging older ears, with the internet becoming colloquial Bahasa Indonesia\u2019s new frontier. The country has close to the freest speech in Asia, and young Indonesians are fanatical fans of Twitter, Facebook, WhatsApp and Instagram, using the platforms to evolve their own language with new and borrowed words. As Andini and I scrolled through Indonesian Twitter feeds during class one day, road-bumps of slang brought me to abrupt and frequent halts.\n\nBy supplementing various informal and regional speeches, Martin-Anatias told me, young Indonesians \u201cestablish intimacy and identity\u201d when conversing, so that they can more accurately convey emotions, express needs and tell jokes.\n\nYet standard Indonesian \u2013 Bahasa Indonesia baku \u2013 remains the best way I have to communicate here, and for me, the language serves its original purpose. As I operate in standard Bahasa Indonesia, I\u2019m pleased to find plenty of people happy to meet me there. When someone speaks to me in a way I easily understand, I read significance into it, knowing they are likely tailoring it for me, adapting themselves, breaking things down as a conscious act of inclusion.\n\nBy supplementing various regional speeches, Indonesians can more accurately convey emotions, express needs and tell jokes\n\nThis happened when I took a motorbike taxi home from class. I understood my young driver near-perfectly. His questions were simply phrased: \u201cIn your country what season is it now?\u201d; \u201cIn your country are there transport apps?\u201d. My own questions he answered in a way designed to ensure clarity. I awkwardly said some just-memorised slang, and he offered a thumbs-up.\n\nKnowing when to scale up speech styles and when to scale them back, and how to successfully balance differing impulses to unity and diversity \u2013 that is Bahasa Indonesia\u2019s and this country\u2019s challenge.\n\nLost in Translation is a BBC Travel series exploring encounters with languages and how they are reflected in a place, people and culture.\n\nJoin more than three million BBC Travel fans by liking us on Facebook, or follow us on Twitter and Instagram.\n\nIf you liked this story, sign up for the weekly bbc.com features newsletter called \"If You Only Read 6 Things This Week\".

In the last century, the number of Romansh speakers has fallen 50% to a meagre 60,000. Travellers in the canton can still see Romansh on street signs, or hear it in restaurants when they\u2019re greeted with \u2018Allegra!\u2019 (Welcome in). But nearly 40% of Romansh speakers have left the area for better job opportunities in places like Z\u00fcrich and it\u2019s rare that you will see or hear Romansh outside the canton. In such a small country, can a language spoken by just a sliver of the population survive, or is it as doomed as the dinosaur and dodo?\n\nYou may also be interested in:\n\n\u2022 The invisible lines through Switzerland\n\n\u2022 The mysterious origins of Europe\u2019s oldest language\n\n\u2022 The town that\u2019s losing its language\n\nRomansh is believed to have originated around 15BC when the Romans conquered Rhaetia, which is now Graub\u00fcnden. Romansh is the result of the combination of the Vulgar Latin spoken by soldiers and colonists, and Rhaetian, the language of the native people. This new hybrid language became the primary language of the area until the 15th Century, when the canton first came together in a loose confederation known as the Free State of the Three Leagues.\n\nThe leagues used German as their primary language, and because local villages were isolated in the mountainous area\u2019s 150 valleys, Romansh fragmented into five somewhat different dialects, each with its own written language. This lack of a uniform standard hindered Romansh\u2019s ability to grow the way German or French did in the country. More and more Germans came to the area, and by the 19th Century, the canton encouraged its Romansh residents to learn German. Today German is the prominent language in Graub\u00fcnden.\n\nYou might think that would be the end of Romansh, but the Swiss are proud of their culture and in 1938 more than 90% of the country voted to make Romansh an official national language. The Swiss government spends about 7.6 million CHF annually to promote and preserve Romansh.\n\nBecause the economics and practicality of having an official language with five idioms was cumbersome, in 1982 an artificial, unified version of Romansh, Rumantsch Grischun, was developed by Heinrich Schmid, a linguist from the University of Z\u00fcrich, and the Lia Rumantscha, a non-profit organisation dedicated to preserving and promoting Romansh language and culture. Since 1996, the unified Romansh has served as the administrative language, but the people of Graub\u00fcnden have resisted giving up their own dialects in favour of the common version.\n\n\u201cThe individual speakers regard unification as a major threat to their own original dialect or idiom,\u201d explained Daniel Telli, head of the Unit Lingua at Lia Rumantscha. \u201cThey frequently consider the unified language as artificial, whereas the variety they use is the language of the heart.\u201d\n\nWithout language you will lose many aspects of the culture\n\nLanguage exists to convey a people\u2019s culture to the next generation, so it makes sense that each area is protective of its unique dialect. When the world loses a language, as it does every two weeks, we collectively lose the knowledge from past generations.\n\n\u201cLanguage is a salient and important expression of cultural identity, and without language you will lose many aspects of the culture,\u201d said Dr Gregory Anderson, Director of the Living Tongues Institute for Endangered Languages.\n\nWithout the Romansh language, who is to say if customs like Chalandamarz, an ancient festival held each 1 March in the Engadine Valley to celebrate the end of winter and coming of spring, will endure; or if traditional local recipes like capuns \u2013 sp\u00e4tzle wrapped in greens \u2013 will be forgotten.\n\nThe five dialects of Romansh The dialects are divided into Rhine (more German influenced), and Engadine (more Italian influenced). Rhine: Sursilvan: The most common of the dialects is found in the Surselva area of the Vorderrhein Valley. Around 60% of the population considers it their primary language. Sutsilvan: Only a small percentage of the 1,000 people in the Hinterrhein Valley still speak their dialect of Romansh. It is the least spoken dialect. Surmiran: This version is spoken in the Albulatal and Vaz/Obervaz area. Engadine: Puter: Spoken in the Upper Engadine Valley, it is the primary language of 30% of the area\u2019s residents. Vallader: Spoken in the Lower Engadine Valley, it is the second most popular dialect and nearly 80% of the population there considers it their primary language.\n\n\u201cRomansh contributes in its own way to a multilingual Switzerland,\u201d Telli said. \u201cAnd on a different level, the death of a language implies the loss of a unique way to see and describe the world.\u201d\n\nBut the number of Romansh speakers continues to dwindle as Graub\u00fcnden residents place a bigger value on more mainstream languages. In many Graub\u00fcnden schools, German is the main language of instruction, with only a handful of smaller villages continuing to teach in a mix of their specific dialect and the unified Romansh. Most schools offer Romansh language lessons, but it is not a required course. Maja Gartmann, a public relations professional who lives in Graub\u00fcnden, for example, elected to learn French, Italian and English instead, languages that will make her more marketable in a globalised economy.\n\nHowever, there is hope on the horizon: in recent years, there has been a slight uptick of interest in Romansh that could help revive the language.\n\nIronically, globalisation might be driving the trend.\n\n\u201cYears ago no-one wanted things that were traditionally Swiss, but now people are tired of everything being the same everywhere. It\u2019s seen as hip and cool to go back to your roots and be more local than global,\u201d Gartmann said. \u201cNow people are proud to speak Romansh because it\u2019s different and rare, and anything that is rare and exclusive is interesting today.\u201d\n\nThe death of a language implies the loss of a unique way to see and describe the world\n\nThere is a Romansh TV and radio station and a Romansh newspaper, all of which use a mix of the unified language and the different dialects; and bookstores like Provini Il Palantin, which carries one of the largest selections of Romansh books in the canton. There is even a hip-hop group who rap in Romansh.\n\n\u201cEveryone in the band grew up in Grison [Graub\u00fcnden],\u201d said Johannes Just, a member of Liricas Analas (Ass Lyrics) \u201cThe language in rap is a tool for expression, and if you don\u2019t rap in your mother tongue you\u2019re more absorbed with the usage of that tool than the free expression of thoughts and ideas. It was never the idea to promote the language by our musical work, but if we can do our part [promoting Romansh] it is a welcome effect.\u201d\n\nAnd technology is helping resuscitate fading languages like Romansh. The language lives on websites and blogs; online apps like Memrise help teach the language; online translators like Romansh English Translator APK can aid communication; and social media sites allow Romansh speakers to connect, especially among younger people. Technology behemoth Google launched The Endangered Languages Project, to preserve the world\u2019s most at-risk languages, including Romansh.\n\nA line from 19th-Century poem Al pievel romontsch (To the Romansh people) by Giachen Caspar Muoth instructed people to \u2018Stand up and defend your ancient language, Romansh!\u2019 What remains to be seen is whether enough canton residents believe that preserving the area\u2019s historic culture and language is a worthy thing to do in the 21st Century.\n\nJoin more than three million BBC Travel fans by liking us on Facebook, or follow us on Twitter and Instagram.\n\nIf you liked this story, sign up for the weekly bbc.com features newsletter called \"If You Only Read 6 Things This Week\".
